As we ve noticed by now, not everyone is a delight to be around. This doesn t make them a bad person necessarily; it just means that they don t necessarily serve as a healthy influence.Even stating that someone is toxic can be a bit harsh; however, if a person displays behavior that has a negative impact on us in any way, it is unhealthy (toxic) for us.Quite frankly, we shouldn t have to subject ourselves to someone else s toxicity.Despite our tendency to want to give someone the benefit of the doubt, it s not mandatory that we do so.Something to address, quickly: it s normal to want to think of something to say while someone else is talking. After all, nobody likes sounding unsure or dumb .Two things: (1) trying to think of something to say when another person is speaking is not effective (2) this is not what makes somebody a bad listener.A lack of acknowledgement, lack of response and just plain disinterest is what makes someone a bad listener. Many times, they ll just continue talking about themselves anyways.&nbsp;

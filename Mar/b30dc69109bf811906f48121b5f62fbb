It s difficult to accept, let alone process the bitter truth that your partner is cheating on you. Because you don t expect them to hurt you in any imaginable way, it seems surreal when you find out about it. It s even worse when you confront them and they deny it.You know deep down that they re keeping something from you and the relationship is not what it used to be, but you keep shrugging off that feeling.You keep telling yourself that it s probably nothing and your mind is playing games with you. Maybe so, but if that feeling persists, you should do something about it.There s a good chance that your partner is cheating on you if you start noticing the following signs:Even if it s something as simple as asking them about their day, they get irritated and try to make you feel bad for your harmless inquiry.You may think that they re in a mood, but can someone be irritable all the time? I don t think so.If they re unable to answer innocent questions, it s a pretty clear sign that they are in fact hiding something from you. And it would be your biggest mistake to ignore it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

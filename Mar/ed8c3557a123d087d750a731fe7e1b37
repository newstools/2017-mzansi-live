An explosive report has detailed how the 26-year old stepdaughter of an Eskom boss has raked in over R1 billion in deals over the span of a year.Sunday Times reports that Matshela Koko, who took over from disgraced former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe last December, has channelled millions in tender contracts to his stepdaughter s company, Impulse International. During his tenure as the group executive head of generation, Koko had oversight and influence on the supply chain management process.While director of the company, Choma received R1 billion worth of Eskom contracts. She lives with Koko and her mother in Bryanston and, despite this, Koko denied knowing she was a director of Impulse International up until a month ago when he advised her to resign due to conflict of interest.The tenders given to Choma s company include a R79 million contract for construction supervision at Kusile power plant, which was extended by a further R198 million and R300 million for trunk cabling for unit 2 at Kusile power station from main contractor ABB last October.Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown said the board would deal with the issue and report back to her. If there is any proof of wrongdoing, Koko will face a disciplinary process, Brown added.Koko has denied he knew about the deals awarded to his stepdaughter s company. He told Sunday Times he didn t know about the deals and had not authorised them. She is a chartered accountant and does her own things, Koko said of Choma. He admitted that once he realised Choma was a beneficiary of Mokoni Trust, which has an interest in Impulse International, he told her to resign. I was appointed as a development candidate to gain as much experience as I could from the company with the objective that one day I will use my experience to assist with running my own company. I am not reliant on my stepdad for my livelihood and do not really engage with him on my business dealings, Choma reportedly responded.

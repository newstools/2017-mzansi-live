We know, she is on your mind when you wake up and when you go to bed. So, why not tell her that? If you two live together, then a good morning and a goodnight kiss should be added to your daily routine. Otherwise, a quick text message is all it takes to tell her that you love her. Sending messages abruptly amidst a busy schedule would make her feel special. But, just don t overdo this. A refreshing change in the routine is enough to make her smile! 1. When a simple thanks is enough Of course your relationship is not a formal one, but a simple thank you can make her feel happy. Whether you have just started dating or have been married for 10 years, this is a trick that never loses its charm. You must recognise her efforts for loving you unconditionally and doing little things to keep you happy. So, bring her favourite dessert when you come back home from work or just hold her hand as you have dinner together.A hug from you would make her feel loved and secure. Not only that, it would definitely bring a smile to her beautiful lips when you decide to surprise her with a casual hug. Just hug her tight from behind to shower your love on her. There is no way she wouldn t smile on that. Well, if nothing else, then as you two are talking, pull her into your arms and casually plant a kiss on her cheeks.&nbsp;

Letting go of a relationship that we did (or still do) care about is a very difficult thing for us all. Whether it s a significant other, friend, or family member, we naturally do not want to bring any hurt upon them or ourselves.There are times, however, where letting go of someone may be the best thing to do even when it doesn t feel good in the present. After all, this is your life and only you can make the ultimate decision whether or not that person fits into it. All the art of living lies in a fine mingling of letting go and holding on. Havelock HarrisThere is a reason that trust is number one because trust is the most important in each andevery kind of relationship. Trust is the foundation upon which a relationship is built, and it is mistrust which often destroys it.Nothing weakens a relationship more than being deceitful.Something to understand when you trust someone and they continuously break your trust, it s not your fault it s theirs. It s very natural to immediately blame yourself for having trusted someone only to have them break that trust, but don t.It s only through experience where we determine whether or not someone is trustworthy; either way, you ll learn a valuable lesson or add a great relationship.&nbsp;

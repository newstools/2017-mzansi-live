If he matches the description, you should stop trying.It can be devastating to be in the early stages of a relationship and then discover that things aren t going as well as you d like them to be. This is supposed to be the happy and innocent stage of your relationship, and yet, you find yourself in deep emotional turmoil. You start to notice that your man is growing more distant and colder over time.You start to think that he may not be as into you as you initially imagined. You think to yourself that perhaps it just takes him more time to open up to other people. Maybe you re the one who is expecting too many things at a pace that s too fast for him to keep up with.However, you should also be open to the possibility that maybe he s not just that into you. Perhaps even early on in the relationship, he doesn t see a future with you in it. If that s the case, then you definitely shouldn t prolong the agony of forcing a relationship that just doesn t mesh well.Save yourself the heartbreak of having to move on from a man you ve become completely invested in.Seek out the signs early on and break things off as early as possible.It s a blatant act of disrespect whenever he starts talking about other girls in your presence.Or perhaps he s trying to send you subliminal messages that he s interested in a lot of other girls who aren t you.Maybe you should take the hint.&nbsp;

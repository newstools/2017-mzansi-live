Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema approached the Constitutional Court in Braamfontein on Thursday to file an application to order speaker of parliament Baleka Mbete to institute an impeachment or disciplinary proceedings against President Jacob Zuma.Speaking to the media outside the court, Malema said his party tried everything and followed protocol to have the president account for his actions, but nothing helped.If the party s application is successful, the president will answer to parliament, the same way Minister of Social Development Bathabile Dlamini did on the Sassa saga. The public would also have the opportunity to have the president answer to them, said Malema. Some say court can t order president to step down. True. But parliament can be instructed to do its job. Court can assert to parliament that there must be a process to hold Zuma accountable. It s our job as MPs. Parliament must do its constitutional duty. We are here to ask the court to ask parliament to do its job! The EFF leader, however, said he was not asking ANC MPs to vote with opposition against their own president. He said he only wanted them to do the right thing, and if they could not vote against Zuma, abstaining was also an option. Some ANC MPs voted against abortion because of religious conscience. This means they can vote out Zuma. But Malema said even though the majority of ANC did not agree with Zuma, they feared speaking out because he will expose their skeletons .Malema said they had to do all that before the president could fire Minister of Finance Pravin Gordhan because once that happened, it would be over.The EFF leader also criticised the intelligence report that the president was allegedly planning to use to justify his sacking of Gordhan, saying it was a propagation of stories and many untruths . They say Pravin s tour in London is aimed at collapsing economy. But they have no evidence to prove this, he said.

Ever been so in love that it made you lose perspective? You got so carried away that you didn t even realise if your partner was anywhere near you.It may be difficult to notice these things, but they re for your own good. You need to know how your partner feels about you and if you re not going insane for someone who s simply not that into you. Hard to realise, even harder to accept and exponentially harder to walk away from.Here are the ten signs of a one-sided relationship;Even though you both are a part of the relationship, it s somehow your job to make all the plans.You re the one checking with them for what suits their schedule and working something out to fit in a date somewhere.Not only that, they re not interested in choosing a place or an activity.You re left to do whatever you please. They re just not as involved in anything.&nbsp;

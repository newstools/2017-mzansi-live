This happened after Mboweni poked fun at receiving royalties ahead of the track&#8217;s release, and called in EFF leader Julius Malema to start negoations.Malema assured the ex-governor that he would sort it out. A couple of hours later Tito announced victory after Cassper reached out to him.But we guess the real victory was on Cassper&#8217;s side as shared that the first single of his upcoming album would drop with no hiccups, because he has Tito Mboweni&#8217;s blessing to release the track.Tito Mboweni is from Cassper&#8217;s upcoming album Thuto which is dropping on May 7.Hey wena Cassper, how do you produce a song about someone with without negotiating first.

A stroke happens when a blood vessel in the brain either becomes blocked (Ischemic) or begins bleeding (Hemorrhagic), both of which can cause severe damage to the brain and even death.Stroke is actually ranked fifth as a cause of death in the U.S. It is also very preventable with exercise, watching your salt intake and keeping your weight at a healthy level.A stroke can happen to anyone at anytime, and if it doesn t kill you, it might cause serious physical and mental damage like paralysis, difficulty thinking or understanding others, and blindness.Unfortunately, the signs of a stroke can often masquerade as other things that we might dismiss.The body is a delicate balance of water, chemicals and hormones. When that balance is disrupted, it can cause the sudden onset of symptoms like fatigue.The system in your body that regulates hormones (endocrine system) is in turn managed by your brain, and when a stroke occurs, your brain is being damaged by a lack or total loss of blood to the affected area.When this happens, it can result in a sudden and severe fatigue or lack of energy. It will happen without warning with no real logical explanation (such as hard work).So if you find yourself suddenly exhausted and lethargic for no good reason, you should see a doctor, as it may be a sign of stroke or other issue.&nbsp;

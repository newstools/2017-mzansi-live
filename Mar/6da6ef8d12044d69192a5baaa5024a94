Certainly, they ignite fire within you and you cannot breathe for the passion that keeps you up at night, but is that what it is? Passion? Love? Or instead, just one of the baser emotions? Could it possibly be lust?I suppose, for me, the first clue should have been during our time together when he said that, You don t have to like the other person to want them. Or perhaps later when he indicated that he is looking for something better, and someone more marriageable in his eyes.A relationship based on lust is great if you know what you are getting yourself into and do it with your eyes wide open, for a good romp in the hay. But what s important is that you don t delude yourself. Here are 7 signs that what you share is lust, and not love.You are always looking your best with them. You eyebrows are waxed, you are invariably dressed to advantage, and your Brazilian is immaculate.Whether you re a man or a woman, the point is that you take particular care in your appearance each time you meet them.In a relationship that is based on more than just the superficial, you and your partner wouldn t care if your hair wasn t perfect some day because your relationship is much more than all that lies outside.

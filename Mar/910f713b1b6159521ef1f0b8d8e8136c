Men can be very supportive and caring for the women they truly love. They would pull out all the stops for their woman s happiness, and make sacrifices when needed.Chances are that if he truly is the man for you, he would meet most of your expectations.But there are certain boundaries that should not be crossed, and certain things that no woman should ever ask of her man.So, as far as expectations go, here are some that a woman simply shouldn t have of her man.The cardinal rule. Ladies, stop doing it. She is the woman who has raised him, taken great pains in order to make him the man he is today.She deserves the respect he accords her with. You are the woman he wants to spend his life with. He chose you. That is of great significance.Asking him to choose one over the other is a source of great distress for your man.If you and she don t get on too well, then endeavour to avoid situations that would lead to conflicts, or seek to ignore aspects of her that never cease to pique you.&nbsp;

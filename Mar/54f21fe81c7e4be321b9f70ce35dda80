Unless you really want a one-night-stand, look out for these signs!When you are in a relationship with someone, you should best expect an absolute whirlwind of emotions. That is a given circumstance because all relationships are always driven by feelings of attraction and comfort.A lot of times, physical attraction is what will pique the interest of most people. We tend to go after people because we are attracted to their appearances and how they carry themselves.Therefore it is normal for two consenting human beings who are physically attracted to engage in physical intimacy with one another. However, it must be understood that just because someone is physically attracted to another person doesn t mean that he/she wants to establish an emotional relationship as well.There have been numerous cases of men who are only looking for physical intimacy with women; treating them as game and sport. In these instances, they will attempt to deceive a woman to the point where she thinks that he wants to genuinely be in a loving relationship with her, but he is only looking for a fun night in the bedroom with her.Ladies, you have to be very careful with these types of men. They have no regard for your feelings and they are only looking out for themselves. They will do whatever it takes to satisfy their carnal cravings even if it means deceiving you.Here are a few signs that his love for you is less than genuine, and that he only wants to get intimate with you physically.He doesn t make time for you unless you guarantee him a fun night in the bedroom with you.Otherwise, he is just going to act disinterested and unwilling. He doesn t like to take time out of his schedule for your dates, hangouts, or just random chill sessions.He only wants to be with you when you re looking to get physically intimate with him.&nbsp;

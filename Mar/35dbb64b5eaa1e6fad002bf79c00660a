Ready for the signs that she might actually be cheating? Here, the experts lay it out.She could be busy with juggling work schedules, making it to yoga class and seeing her girlfriends but if she s not telling you about her day, there s a chance she s telling someone else. While distance can, at times, make the heart grow fonder, if she no longer thinks to call you when something good, bad, funny, ridiculous or awful happens it might be scary for you to think who she could be talking to. A way to bring it up to her is to let her know how much you miss her, dammit. She might be overly stressed about something unrelated to your relationship, she might be upset about something you did, or she might feel like you are pulling away and she doesn t know how to talk to you about it, Schewitz says. The best thing to do is ask her what s going on. Say something like Hey babe, I ve noticed you seem a little distant lately. I miss feeling close to you. Is there something you want to talk about or something I could do to bring us closer together again? &nbsp;

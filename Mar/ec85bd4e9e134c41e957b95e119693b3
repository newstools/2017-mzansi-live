Making people value and respect you, especially the guy you have been crushing on, takes a bit more work than jumping up and down, saying, Pick me! Pick me! There is a bunch of silly advice out there that involves tricking guys into falling for a version of you that does not exist. If you really want him to see you for who you are and value you immensely, you need to be what he does not know he needs.Sounds difficult, right?Some people call this the save the day method. I call shenanigans. Saving people is great and all, but you are not a Wonder Woman. Do not overextend yourself for someone, even when you are trying to make them see what you can deliver. That leads to a bizarre game of give-and-take, where he takes everything and you receive nothing in return. So, if you really want him to respect and value you, do the following:Men are attracted to women who not only have confidence but pride in who they are, where they are from, and what they have done. Confidence is so much more than dressing a certain way. When you can humbly and intelligently piece together conversation, he will value you more, because of the insight and quality of discussion you can provide.Confidence in your skills for fixing tires or cooking ethnic food, for example, is also something he will find interesting and of value. By the way, if he is not interested in real, stimulating conversation, I guarantee you that he is only looking for booty.&nbsp;

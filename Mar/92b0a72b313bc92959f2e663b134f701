In an interview with Drum magazine Ayanda confirmed that she and her mother-in-law haven&#8217;t had the best relationship.Ayanda said that their relationship was strained, and claimed that Fikile had apparently not checked on her since the gospel star&#8217;s death.&#8220;Not really. She has not checked on us. Sfiso was all about healing through song. I thought the funeral would unite us,&#8221; she said.Ayanda also set the record straight on swirling reports that she had kept information about Sfiso&#8217;s death away from his mother.She rubbished the claim explaining that in the moments, after Sfiso&#8217;s death she immediately sent a car to fetch Fikile, so that they could &#8220;do everything together&#8221;.&#8220;If family members want to know something they know what to do. I will not disrespect my husband and publish his post-mortem report,&#8221; she said.Earlier this month Ayanda told Ukhozi FM that she did not want to disrespect Sfiso&#8217;s memory by discussing their family issues in public. &#8220;I am hurt by some of the stories that have come up after my husband passed. Sfiso respected himself a lot. As his wife I will never disrespect his memory by failing his family or our children, with my behaviour. Because that is what he has taught me,&#8221; she said at the time.

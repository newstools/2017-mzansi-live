Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini lost her cool at a press conference about the country s looming social grants crisis when asked a series of probing questions by a journalist.Dlamini held the media briefing on Sunday amid growing concerns that social grants will not be paid to millions of South Africans on April 1.She became visibly agitated with pointed questions from eNCA&#8217;s Karyn Maughan particularly over the reported breakdown of working relations between her and CEO Thokozani Magwaza.Magwaza is reported to be on sick leave however recent media reports suggested that he was facing suspension for allegedly negotiating with the Post Office behind Dlamini&#8217;s back.Her reaction to some of the questions further strengthened the perception that the payments of social grants was not under control. Minister with all due respect you are constitutionally mandated said Maughan who got into a verbal altercation with Dlamini. Don t come here with your preconceived ideas. If I did not stand up you are going to say I am a lame duck replied Dlamini who blamed the media for manufacturing a crisis around the payment of grants.Watch the video of Dlamini and Maughan going toe-to-toe and decide for yourself.

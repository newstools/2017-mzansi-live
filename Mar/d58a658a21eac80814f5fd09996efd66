&nbsp;Actor Mangaliso Ngema took to social media on Wednesday to comment on a meeting between the family and the church.&#8220;We visited the Joe Mafela home last night to pay our respects. I was shocked to learn that Grace Bible Church wanted a fee of R89,000 for the memorial. When the head pastor (Musa) Sona was consulted, he offered a R10k discount. Needless to say there was no deal as this was totally ridiculous. This is supposed to be a &#8216;house of God&#8217; serving the community,&#8221; he wrote.The Joburg Theatre has since been secured as a venue for the memorial.Attempts to reach the church was unsuccessful but speaking to Sowetan head pastor Musa Sona said arrangements between the church and family members were private.&#8220;Kindly note that as GBD (Grace Bible Church) we don&#8217;t comment on arrangements between people seeking to use our facilities for memorial services. The Mafela family will be best placed to give you a response.&#8221;Memorial services for Mandoza, Sfiso Ncwane and Lundi Tyamara have all occurred at the church.

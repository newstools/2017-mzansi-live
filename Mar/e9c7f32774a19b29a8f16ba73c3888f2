Baxter is a strong contender for the vacant position at Bafana Bafana after being formally approached by SafaThe South African Football Association (Safa) has officially approached SuperSport United head coach Stuart Baxter for the Bafana Bafana job.The 63-year-old previously distanced himself from the reports as Safa had not spoken to him about the vacant position.However, Baxter&#8217;s agent, Steve Kapeluschnik, confirmed on Thursday that Safa formally approached his client for the job.Kapeluschnik said he will only meet with Baxter after the Baroka game this coming weekend to discuss Safa&#8217;s offer.Reports suggest that Matsatsantsa have already given Baxter permission to begin talks with the country&#8217;s FA.On Wednesday, Safa confirmed that four coaches were still in the running for the plum job without revealing names of the candidates.Should Baxter accept Safa&#8217;s offer, he would be returning to the position he held between 2004 and 2005.He was shown the exit door in 2005 following Bafana&#8217;s failure to qualify for the 2006 Fifa World Cup in Germany.Safa is desperate to find Shakes Mashaba&#8217;s successor before the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying campaign gets underway in June this year.

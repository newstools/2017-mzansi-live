Following Nonhlanhla Skolopad Qwabe s attendance at the Metro FM Awards in a revealing yellow dress last month, the woman has been making headlines for, among other things, defending her dress and sharing her dreams with those who are listening.Skolopad, a DJ and professional nurse, has also left her fans wondering if she was the inspiration behind the dress Bonang Matheba wore at the Veuve Clicquot Polo event in Cape Town on Saturday.The dress, designed by Gert-Johan Coetzee, left Bonang serving us some thigh game, something she hardly ever does in a dress.Even Skolopad noticed the change in Bonang s style and commended her for revealing her hot bod.Ungawusabisi #Umzimba pic.twitter.com/iZOMAxZVxj&mdash; #UMZIMBA Skolopad (@nonhlanhlaqwab1) March 4, 2017&nbsp;Did @nonhlanhlaqwab1 set a trend? https://t.co/nCsTkx0nqS&mdash; Akanyang Merementsi (@AkanyangM) March 4, 2017 Keep calm and slowly follow Skolopad, she tweeted.However, Skolopad said she wore that revealing dress as a publicity stunt to market her upcoming album and raise funds to complete her nursing degree. She has been been moonlighting at Mediclinic as a professional nurse. I m focused in life, she told her followers.Sometimes I moonlight at this hospital as a professional nurse. Skolopad is not just about #Umzimba.

I know God will help us all, she said.Apart from the gigs she has been booked for to go and perform, she has also been trying to reach music producer Heavy K. We may soon hear of a collaboration between the two.The dancer has been in demand, with some event organisers already using her name to attract people to their events.&nbsp;

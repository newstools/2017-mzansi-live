The word inflammation doesn t really evoke much concern, does it? Actually, many people associate inflammation with swelling which, is true to some extent however, inflammation can actually be a very dangerous thing.Strange as it sounds, inflammation is actually a necessary defense mechanism of the body: Inflammation is the body s attempt at self-protection; the aim being to remove harmful stimuli, including damaged cells, irritants, or pathogens and begin the healing process. However, inflammation of the chronic variety can be very harmful.As can be gathered by reading a snippet of the inflammation study preceding this article, inflammation can actually cause a wide range of diseases, some of them fatal. Chronic (long-term) inflammation has been associated with conditions such as Alzheimer s, cancer, heart disease and stroke.Not so surprisingly, our diets affect the inflammatory response in the body. In America along with other developed nations this is bad news; as our shelves are stocked with heavily-processed foods and ingredients.Pretty much everything that it fried has a thick layer of fat, also known as batter, around it. As unhealthy as this unnecessary fat is, it is actually the temperatures that fried food is prepared in that primarily causes inflammation.Fried foods are prepared at temperatures between 350-375 degrees. At this range, the food forms glycation end-products that are very unhealthy.Actually, the body perceives these byproducts as threats and initiates an inflammation response.So, when the urge to chow down on fried chicken or French fries arises try to think twice!&nbsp;

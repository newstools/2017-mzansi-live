The first major factor holding women back from making the first move is traditional gender roles. Like it or not, we have an existing social script that says that men should be the pursuers of dates and s_ex and women should be pursued. Many women are put off the idea of veering away from that script because they feel as though it will make them seem unfeminine or too aggressive.To counter this one, start by examining your own beliefs first. It might help for you to widen your own ideas of what constitutes acceptable feminine behavior, if you haven&#8217;t already. For example, if you&#8217;d like women to be more forward in the dating world, are you also encouraging them to be more forward in the office and in your social circles? If you&#8217;d warmly encourage women to walk up to you and hit on you, would you also encourage them to speak their mind in other contexts?A lot of these ideas need a society-wide social shift, and you won&#8217;t be able to bring this about on your own, no matter how progressive you are in your thinking here. But you can help promote an expanded idea of femininity by talking to the people around you about why you think outdated gender roles need to shift.&nbsp;

Minister of Higher Education Blade Nzimande on Monday afternoon launched South Africa s first school of schools of witchcraft and wizardry. The school which is located in Durban KwaZulu Natal, has opened its doors as of today.This school is the first of its kind in South Africa and its purpose is to empower those who want to practice witchcraft and wizardry. You need a license to practice witchcraft in South Africa. We are sick and tired of witches operating without licenses. Just like doctors and engineers, if pastors go to bible college to learn about ministry; witches and wizards should also go to school to learn how to use their gifts so they can operate accordingly and also to preserve the African culture. said Minister Nzimande.To be enrolled to this school, one needs to have passed Mathematics and Physical Science in in grade 12. Application forms will be made available on the school s website as soon as it goes live this morning.More schools will be opened all over the country by January next year.Source : Online

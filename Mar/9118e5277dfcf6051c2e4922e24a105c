The Ndikhokhele hitmaker spoke to YFM&#8217;s DJ Speedsta about the conditions he lived under in prison during an interview this week.&#8220;Prison is everything you think it is and so much more. It s a school of hard knocks and survival of the fittest. It&#8217;s not good,&#8221; Jub Jub said.He explained that prison had even robbed him of his physique. &#8220;I went in a sexy guy and came out fat,&#8221; Jub Jub joked about his weight gain.He explained that the reason for this was because he spent all of his time writing music, and a book.&#8220;I didn&#8217;t have time to gym because I was writing and writing and praying so much,&#8221; he added.He admitted that he was so dedicated to his writing projects that he even ran out of pens.Jub Jub told Metro FM last week that the book he had written was a &#8220;tell-all&#8221; and that he also hoped to make a movie out of his life story.&#8220;I don&#8217;t really like sharing my plans, but since you have asked, I had a lot of time to write and I have a book coming out,&#8221; he told Bonang.

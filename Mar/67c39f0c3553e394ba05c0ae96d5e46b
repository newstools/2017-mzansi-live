Beauty comes with a price, and who knows this better than Beyonc Giselle Knowles-Carter?The Los Angeles premiere of Beauty and the Beast took place last week.The glitzy and glamorous event included appearances by a number of Hollywood stars. Emma Watson, Matt Damon, Celine Dion, John Legend and Chrissy Teigen are just a few to name.Queen Bey and her daughter Blue Ivy did not walk the red carpet, so they didn t get a chance to be properly photographed. But the pair aren t making headlines for coming late to the event.Both mother and daughter wore matching Gucci gowns to the event. It s really baby Ivy s dress that deserves all the attention though.She wore a $2 100 dress from the children s range of Gucci. That s close to R27 500!The exact same version of the dress for adults sells for $26 000 (R340 000).Don t worry, you re not the only one who just had a mini heart attack. People on social media are also in shock.Here s what some of them had to say:Blue Ivy Carter wore a Gucci dress that cost more than what I earn in a year to the movies.. Blue Ivy Carter is 5.. What https://t.co/4fCQMxHNcf&mdash; chelsey drewery (@chelseydrewery) March 7, 2017&nbsp;Blue ivy&#39;s dress costs 26,000, which is more than I will earn in a year when I&#39;m a qualified nurse &mdash; Isla (@isla_feming) March 7, 2017&nbsp;It&#39;s totally fine that blue ivy&#39;s dress coats more money than I have in my savings https://t.co/j5T49BRLLa&mdash; King Kristin (@kristin313) March 7, 2017&nbsp;Some believe Beyonc might just be spoiling her little girl a bit too much. All we know is we d love to see what Queen B s twin babies are going to wear one day.

S_ex dreams, especially ones involving doing it with a person you would never, ever want to see naked in real life, can be quite disturbing. I once had a dream about a boss who I was absolutely repulsed by.Not only was he extremely unattractive to me, but his arrogance and condescending attitude made him extra, extra unsexy.Also, he walked like Bigfoot. And when he ate, the food always ended up all over his face. Yet still, there he was in my dream, naked and on top of me in his office.And I was into it. YUCK!!No, it doesn t mean you want to get back together. If you have a racy dream about your ex, don t pick up the phone. It most likely means that you re still processing some unfinished feelings about him or her.If you are with someone new, the ex s_ex dream might signify fears you are having about your new relationship and/or the resurgence of the types of feelings you felt with your ex.Pay close attention to the nature of the sexual experience and how you felt during the dream, as it will give you insight into what type of unfinished feelings you have about your ex.For years and years, I had a variation on a s.x dream with an ex where I would be in bed with him and find girls hiding in his bedroom or under his bed and I would feel betrayed.Although he never cheated on me, I came to understand that these dreams represented me always feeling like he was hiding something from me and I never really understood why things ended between us.&nbsp;

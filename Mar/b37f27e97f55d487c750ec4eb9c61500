Zimbabweans will have to be disciplined from now as their President is reported to have passed the law that prohibits them to have sexual relationships before marriage. We have to restore order and pluck out elements which cause many families to collapse. So, from now onwards the minimum jail term for outside marriage sex is 5 years. It doesn t matter even when you have not married as yet. We have advised our Justice Ministry to effect the law from now onwards, Mugabe said on national television.The developments have been met with different reactions across Africa. Many human rights organisations have called the Zimbabwe government to act and reverse the law imposed by the President. Chimimba David Phiri, UN Sub Regional Coordinator for Southern Africa and Representative in Zimbabwe has described the law as an act of human rights abuse. It is sad that Zimbabwe is being dragged backwards by some the laws enacted in the country. This is an act of human rights abuse, he saidZimbabweans have started a petition to compel the African Union to deal with the situation. They hope that the decision will be reversed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

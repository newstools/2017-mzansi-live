Zuma is meeting with the affected ministers tonight regarding the cabinet reshuffle, ANN7 and SABC reports.No names have been released at this stage, though it is said that 9 ministers and 6 deputies have been fired. This is yet to be confirmed by the presidency.Zuma called an urgent meeting with Cyril Ramaphosa Baleka Mbete Gwede Mantashe Jessie Duarte and Zweli Mkhize to finalise the removals of the ministers. They met at his presidential home, Mahlambandlopfu.The SACP revealed on Thursday at a press briefing that Zuma had informed them of his intention to remove Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas this week. Zuma apparently based his decision on an intelligence report which stated that Gordhan and Jonas had set up meetings with people who would push for a change in government.The pair were recalled from an international investor roadshow in London and returned to SA on Tuesday. Though Zuma has not given reasons for the recall, it is widely understood that Gordhan and Jonas will be part of the ministers who will be axed in the Cabinet reshuffle.Reports suggests that Gordhan and his deputy are among those axed.The SACP said they did not support Zuma s decision to have the ministers recalled as this would affect the country s economic status.

A lot of times, relationships can be going very well and the people involved establish a sense of stability and complacency. As a man, you have a natural tendency to not overthink things. You don t like to overanalyze the nuances of your relationship, and you tend to take a very nonchalant approach to romance.However, you must always maintain proper presence of mind in the relationship; at least enough for you to be able to spot patterns that indicate signs of a dysfunctional partnership between you and your girl.This way, if you are able to maintain your presence of mind, you will have a sense of control for the situation, and you won t be relegated to being a victim. You see, there are numerous instances wherein one party of a relationship ends up being abused and misused.You never know when you are playing the fool in the relationship unless you know where to look. You should never allow yourself to be taken advantage of, and that s why you need to always be wary of the signs.A person can be used in a variety of ways that don t evolve love, but the most common instance is when women use men for their finances.You don t want to be used as a woman s personal piggy bank, and so you must take action immediately if you notice some of these things in your relationship.It would be weird if she didn t want to let you take a peek into her life. If she truly were in love with you, she would have no problem with integrating you within her social circles.Either she s ashamed of you, or she really isn t in love with you and is just manipulating her way through the relationship.&nbsp;

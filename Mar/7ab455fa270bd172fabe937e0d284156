Can you count how many times you ve said Sorry today? Do you remember what for you said it?Chances are you ve said you re sorry for many things that you don t even remember doing.Saying I m sorry and apologizing for things that aren t completely your fault is not a bad thing. It doesn t make you weak or a pushover. On the contrary, the ability to apologize is a positive human trait.It is one of the building blocks of emotional intelligence and reflects strong interpersonal skills. When you say you re sorry, it doesn t necessarily mean you re accepting blame for a situation.Rather, it is a way of acknowledging that the other person was hurt in some way, regardless of whose fault was.That said, there are things that you can say I m sorry for that don t require an apology.There are some situations in life that can hurt or offend other people but that are necessary for your own happiness, personal growth, or self-esteem.Making decisions or taking actions that hurt others doesn t make you a bad person or uncaring. It shows that you care about yourself enough to make difficult choices when they are in your best interest.1. Making a positive change in your life or yourself.Positive change should be rewarded, not punished. However, many people around you don t want you to change, even if the change is clearly better for you. Good or bad, they want you to remain the same.Why? Because it is easier for them. They know what to expect from you. They know how to respond to you and what can be asked from you. You are predictable, and the boundaries between you and them are quite clear, even if they are not always fair for both parties.Therefore, stand firm in your right to change. It is not only your responsibility, but it s your right as well.Yes, some people will have a hard time to adjusting to change, but they can adjust eventually if they are willing. You can feel sorry that you ve upset them, but you don t need to apologize for making change that is right for you.&nbsp;

Mr. Right and Prince Charming are the stuff of legends. There, I said it. While you can spend a majority of your time searching for the one who fits your idea of perfection, there are actually realistic traits you should be looking for in the human being you desire to spend the rest of your life with. Because, while he might seem like everything now, there are specific qualities you should look for in a future husband.Obvious quality, I know. So why is it that people so often forget to consider how committed they are to one another before tying the knot? I know I want someone who is committed to the relationship as they are to waking up in the morning and succeeding at life.I want someone who understands that relationships require effort but is not frightened by the premise. Because, obviously, if he is committed to me and the time we spend together, he is going to maintain that view when we get a house, a dog, potentially have a baby, and then work towards retirement.&nbsp;

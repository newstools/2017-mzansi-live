She made reference to the fact that most &#8220;talent&#8221; are never on permanent contracts but are considered freelancers.&#8220;We can&#8217;t get a loan. We are not happy. We pose for selfies and sign autographs but we are not happy. We battle. I&#8217;ve been on Muvhango for 18 years and I have never been permanent.&#8221;Making reference to the fact that many actors die poor, Cynthia said that it is not for a lack of trying.&#8220;When one of us die, it&#8217;s not like we don&#8217;t like we don&#8217;t know how to save, it&#8217;s that we don&#8217;t have the money. This is our passion. We do it because we love it. But we are not happy.&#8221; She was speaking at the memorial service for the late Joe Mafela who died in a car accident on Saturday night.

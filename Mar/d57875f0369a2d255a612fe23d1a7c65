That is why Zuma is so powerful &#8221; Malema said speaking on Power FM on Thursday. &#8220;Zuma is the centre of power. He gives himself a mandate and he is accountable to himself. Malema said cabinet ministers see Zuma as their employer despite the fact that they never applied for their jobs. &#8220;[Pravin] Gordhan must not see himself as Zuma s employee. He never submitted a CV. He never subjected himself to an interview.&#8221; Malema said when he attended struggle veteran Ahmed Kathrada&#8217;s funeral he realised that the &#8220;real&#8221; ANC was outside the organisation.&#8220;When I was sitting there and looking at the old ANC veterans I realised the real ANC is outside the ANC. Mantashe likes to act like a genuine person. He said [at the funeral] that &#8216;ANC veterans must reprimand us&#8217; but they have not been listening.&#8221;He said the fact that Zuma did not respond to Kathrada&#8217;s letter in which the stalwart asked him to step down as president was not surprising. &#8220;It&#8217;s typical of Zuma. If you speak to him about a veteran he will tell that they are a good leader but you must be careful of them.They [veterans] are all treated with suspicion &#8221; he said. He said the intelligence report Zuma reportedly relied on to recall Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas from their investor road shows in the UK and the US was &#8220;nonsensical&#8221;.&#8220;It s the most stupid thing I ve ever heard. Pravin submitted his itinerary to the president. [The trip] was public. Gordhan was in the company of public servants.&#8221;This week Zuma called Gordhan from London and stopped Jonas from going to the United States to meet with investors. According to reports Zuma acted on an intelligence report that claimed Gordhan and Jonas were to use the investor roadshow to mobilise prominent people in London and the US to act against the state.

Drake hinted at a new version of Black Coffee&#8217;s Superman in an Instagram video late last year, but the track was not confirmed by either camp until now.Black Coffee let the cat out the bag during an interview with East Coast Radio&#8217;s Phat Joe, revealing that Drake had called him the night before to let him listen to the track and get his thoughts.Black Coffee also revealed that the song would be on Drake&#8217;s highly-anticipated upcoming mixtape.&#8220;He is going to take the song to another level. People are going to love his version of the song but it won&#8217;t erase the original&#8230;People had mixed feelings, like; &#8216;why would you give someone else your song? It is your song! Why are you letting them shine on the song?&#8217; But my understanding is different. I would love for our music to be exported on that level,&#8221; he said.Black Coffee&#8217;s management told MzansiLIVE that the pair were sorting out the finer details of the project and would only be able to reveal more details soon.&#8220;We need to finalise everything and once it has all been signed and is ready, we will comment on it,&#8221; Black Coffee&#8217;s manager Amaru Da Costa said.Drake is a big fan of Black Coffee and last year featured the DJ&#8217;s Superman track on a special Apple Music radio show of his favourite tracks.

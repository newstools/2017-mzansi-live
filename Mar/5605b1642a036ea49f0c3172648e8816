QUESTION: I&#8217;m 23 years old and have been dating my boyfriend for five years. I have been cheating ever since I met him.I have stopped cheating, but my man always beats me up. He doesn&#8217;t believe that I have stopped. I have learned that cheating is not good. I want to be loved again. Please help me!Aunty Mzansi replies: You have been dating and cheating since you were 19? I want to talk as a mother now and not as a relationship coach.How far did you go in school? Are you currently employed? Where do you see yourself in five years&#8217; time? I would advise you to forget about men a bit and focus a lot on improving your life. Work on you.You clearly are missing something and keep looking for it from men.Dr Love replies: Sometimes we are socialised into certain lifestyles or we have a void in our lives that we try to fill with unhealthy lifestyle choices, which in your case is promiscuity.It would benefit you tremendously to seek counselling to re-learn healthy coping skills. You have stopped because your boyfriend beats you up, but it&#8217;s not because you want to change.You have not owned up to your problem and until then you might struggle to get it under control.&nbsp;

We all have good and bad times in our relationship, but there are times when things get out of our control and we just stand there clueless, not sure whether to go through it or away from it.When we are finally out of a dead-end relationship, we often wish we could have seen the signs, but only a few of us can see them during the relationship and not after it, we are oh-so-blinded-by-love, after all.If any of these signs are persistently a part of your relationship, you have a serious problem to consider.Having fights every now and then does not signify an unhealthy relationship, they are a part of human interaction and how we choose to resolve conflicts.What should ring a bell is, when these fights become so frequent that it is actually surprising when a day goes by without fighting, when fighting becomes the only way you two communicate, when the fights get so gruesome that they go far enough to involve verbal or physical abuse, no apology can ever make up for this hurt and disrespect.Nobody deserves to be in a negative, draining relationship.Your friends avoid hanging out with you guys as a couple because you have turned into an always fighting duo, you radiate negative vibes.If you find yourself always engaged in an inconclusive fight, over and over again, be it petty issues or serious ones, it s time to take yourself out of the vicious cycle.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Men and women are inherently different. Obviously. But we women understand men without a problem, or even a thought, most days (unless we are trying to understand why they get so emotional about men in tight suits throwing a ball around on Sundays, then we might be a little lost).But when it comes to men doing the same, they are a little hopeless. We try to teach them, but usually, their mind is out in space when we are talking. And sometimes, there are just things they will never truly understand, like these seven girl problems we face all the time:I admit, some men are more mature and educated than others. But then you get the men that are just as clueless as a baby when it comes to woman s cycle. (One boyfriend of mine did not even know we peed from a different place, like c mon guys).Men seem to only understand they need to treat us gently and give us food and chocolate to appease us while shark week is in town. But really, they will never understand the pain, the cramps, the emotional war inside us for no reason but stupid hormones, and all of the other wonderful symptoms of periods.&nbsp;

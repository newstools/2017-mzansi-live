A police spokesman close to the investigation confirmed to MzansiLIVE on Sunday that the mother was taken into custody for questioning.Asked via text message if the mom was arrested, the source simply said: &#8220;Yes.&#8221;Several other sources confirmed she was arrested in the early hours of the morning.Siwaphiwe was taken in an apparent hijacking near the City View shopping centre in Greyville Durban on Friday.The white Toyota Yaris was found abandoned about 12km away in Moodie Crescent, Montclair, hours later.Siwaphiwe, her car seat, pram and baby bag had all been removed.She was recovered in the early hours of Sunday morning. A police source who could not be named said that police had intercepted a vehicle which had been traveling on the N3 at Marianhill Toll Plaza and that baby Siwaphiwe had been found inside.A close family member was among three people arrested.Yesterday, a senior officer with intimate knowledge of the case told the Sunday Times that the supposed kidnapping was &#8220;strange beyond measure&#8221;.He said: &#8220;If they were after the car, we would expect to find the dash [dashboard] stripped while they were looking for the tracker [but] the car was pristine.&#8220;Professional car thieves would never take a baby &#8230; They don&#8217;t want &#8230; publicity.&#8220;The fact that the baby booster seat and other paraphernalia for childcare were taken is also very strange.&#8220;We are asking questions &#8230; [and] looking at the family for people of interest.&#8221;This is a developing story.

In front of a capacity crowd, Bafana started well enough and in the eighth minute, Phakamani Mahlambi found Percy Tau inside the penalty area, and he tried to cut the ball back for Mahlambi, but the Angolan defence cleared.There was a strange incident in the early stages too, as the referee appeared to accidentally headbutt an Angolan player, sending him theatrically crashing to the turf.In the 24th minute, Bafana captain-for-the-evening Andile Jali did not set a good example as he was yellow-carded for a rather pointless argument with an assistant referee.Four minutes later, Tau s fine pass found Mahlambi in space, but he couldn t get his cross past the first defender.On the half hour mark, Tau got in behind the Angolan defence, latching onto a long free kick, but he could not get enough power on his effort, and it was easily cleared.Angola grew into the game as the half wore on and in the 32nd minute, Yano s long range-effort went straight into the grateful arms of Darren Keet.In the 39th minute, Keet had to do even better, diving to his left to claw away Herenilson s effort.Two minutes before half time, Tiyani Mabunda gave the ball away to Yano in central midfield and Rivaldo Coetzee was booked for bringing down the Palancas Negras striker..Ramahlwe Mphahlele, Keagan Dolly, Themba Zwane and Thulani Serero all came on for the second half, with Diamond Thopola, Mahlambi, Luther Singh and Lebogang Manyama making way.Tau almost got away again minutes after half time, with Angolan goalkeeper Neblu racing off his line to just get a hand to the ball at the feet of the Sundowns striker.Angola continued to threaten, however, and after Ary Papel could not get enough power on a header to beat Keet, a screamer from Quibeto skimmed the top of the crossbar.Dolly hit a fine long-range effort in the 58th minute, but Neblu dived to his left to make the save.Dolly turned provider in the 64th minute as his pass found Tebogo Langerman, and his shot was just deflected wide by Bastos.Kermit Erasmus got a run in the 73rd minute, replacing Tau, and in the 82nd minute he cracked an effort over the bar.Erasmus then wasted a glorious opportunity with two minutes left as Neblu had a rush of blood to the head, racing off his line and chesting the ball straight to Mphahlele. The right back headed the ball to Erasmus, but with the goalkeeper out of position, he mis-controlled, rather summng up Bafana s evening.There was one more save for Neblu to make, tipping over Rivaldo Coetzee s looping header.

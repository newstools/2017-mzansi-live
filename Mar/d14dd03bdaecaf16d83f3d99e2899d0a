Africa has been hit by a disease that eats into the fingers. The disease is sexually transmitted, but only affects fingers especially of men who use their fingers for sexual acts.Doctors and NGOs in South Africa have warned men not to use fingers when they touch their partners privates as they risk their fingers to be eaten up. 3 cases have been reported so far. One case involves a man from Pretoria who admitted to have been involved in a sexual act with a prostitute from the same town. Another case involves a student from the University of Johannesburg who was also involved in a sexual act with a student from the same college.INSTANT PERSONAL LOANS!!!

The understanding is that the infection is carried by women&#8217;s sexual organs. It grows in &#8216;private parts&#8217; that are not washed regularly.The major challenge that NGOs have cited is the absence of protective material for fingers. Unlike condoms, men don&#8217;t usually wear gloves during the act. Research scientists are coming up with ways to avoid the spread of the disease. Protective clothing will be the first line of defense.INSTANT CAR LOANS!!!- Click HERE to fill in form and get fast approval (South Africa Only)

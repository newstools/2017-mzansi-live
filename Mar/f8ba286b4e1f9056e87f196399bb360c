Living in the society we do, we re force fed ideas and belief systems. Unconsciously we are molded by everything that goes on around us.Consequently we grow used to them, and fail to see the wrong in them. Some of us lose the ability to see beyond what we ve always been taught or made to believe.And those of us who dare even think let alone do anything differently face numerous difficulties. It s virtually impossible for someone to be themselves and to go after what they truly desire.When it comes to relationships, we ve been brought up thinking that only when you re with someone, you feel complete; otherwise something will always be missing.And that being in love creates dependency and so on. Women particularly tend to get carried away with these ideas and set unrealistic expectations of their relationships.They need to understand that relationships play out very differently in real life than fiction. And it s absolutely normal to think and feel against the norms set forth. You can shape your relationships along with your partner the way you see fit.A few realities about relationships that women should know are as follows:Unlike the movies, there isn t going to be a knight in shining armor to save you from your demons. You are your own savior.You can t depend on anyone, including him, to catch you every time you fall. Just like you d like for him to be capable of taking care of himself, he d prefer the same from you.If saving you is all he ever does, the relationship won t be fulfilling for either of you.So may be lay off the whole damsel in distress bit and learn to take care of yourself.He can only be there for you when you need him, but you alone are responsible for your life and happiness.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Things are tough at home right now and have been for some time. Do you press the eject button or do you press on?Before throwing your partner s things in a bin liner and calling a divorce lawyer, let us take a trip to the beautiful islands of Hawaii.Here is the normal scenario. There is a disagreement or argument brewing. Wife wants to fight. Husband wants to withdraw. She gives chase, hoping for a reaction and he normally tries to stay silent. Naturally, these roles can be reversed.Asking the above question to your partner tells them subtly that you want to connect, not withdraw or avoid. This will in turn calm them down, which gives licence to civilised discussion and possible problem solving.&nbsp;

Do you have trouble finding your true love? Are you sick and tired of loneliness but afraid to change the situation? Chances are, you allow these factors to prevent you from being happy with a person you love. Eliminating these factors from your life will help you find your true love and eventually become happy.I am not telling you to look for the guys in the library, but online dating is not the best option too. When you look for your true love in the wrong place, you meet the wrong type of men and end up with a broken heart. Instead of dating a guy who wants only hook-up just to banish your loneliness for a while, take time and find a right man that will make you happy in the long run.&nbsp;

A young woman tragically died after catching a deadly bacterial infection just hours after getting married to the love of her life. Jamieka McCarthy Harford died in Auckland, New Zealand on Saturday after falling ill during her wedding ceremony. The 26-year-old’s death was caused by a bacterial infection linked to meningitis. A beautiful picture posted on Facebook show the blushing bride walking down the aisle with her father, Will Catchakingi, by her side on a sunny golf course. Her husband Alistair told the NZ Herald he was devastated by the sudden death of his new wife. “Her passing was a huge shock to everybody to lose her so quickly and this has been incredibly difficult to process,” says Alistair. “She was taken from us without notice by a horrible, deadly disease.” In a statement released by her family, they described Jamieka as a kind-hearted and selfless person. “Jamieka was so happy to be married and the wedding was a beautiful, happy occasion surrounded by love,” they said.

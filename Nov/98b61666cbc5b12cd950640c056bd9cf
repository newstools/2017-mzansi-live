Skolopad has done it again by causing a frenzy with a WORS outfit she wore to the 2017 Feather Awards. The controversial singer singer who is a nurse by profession showed upon the  red carpet dressed in a clear plastic dress draped in wors.  “I wore it to show that I don’t like beef. Wors is easy to braai. And like I have my charcoal, I’m ready to braai after this. The outfit is also to remind people that I am still Queen Skolopad, the original.” Skolopad and Zodwa are seemingly beefing after Zodwa refused to take a photo with her at the Feather awards nominations party last month.

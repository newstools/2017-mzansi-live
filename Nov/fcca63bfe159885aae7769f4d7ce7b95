SA’s Got Talent finalists AmaZebra have been robbed while on their way to King Shaka International Airport, north of Durban. The group of about 16 traditional Zulu dancers who are scheduled to compete in the competition’s finale on Sunday, November 12, were robbed of their belongings and documents. No members of the group were hurt. It was not immediately clear what belongings and documents they were robbed of and where exactly in Durban. The group from Ntuzuma – a township north of Durban – was travelling to Lanseria airport in Johannesburg to prepare for the finale set to take place at Soweto Theatre at 18:00 on Sunday when they were robbed. A source at the airport said the group missed their morning flight and they had to be rebooked on a 13:00 flight. “Despite this unfortunate event, Amazebra’s participation in the SA’s Got Talent will go ahead and e.tv and Rapid Blue, the production company of SA’s Got Talent, will provide full support for the group of contestants. AmaZebra will compete with Nan Hua Dancers, Art of Dance, acapella groups Just 6 and Anecnote and Opera singer Siphokazi for the prize money of R500 000.

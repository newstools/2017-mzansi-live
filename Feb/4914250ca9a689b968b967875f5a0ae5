 Men don’t express as vigorously as women and aren’t very open either. But there are some things that they do that you just cannot ignore. They make your heart melt and you look at them with puppy eyes. These are common gestures and when looked at separately are super adorable. Some of these cute things that men do are also their way of saying that they care. The hints they pass are subtle and the things they do to express their feelings even subtler. These are some of those adorably small and cute gestures that men perform that you won’t be able to resist. When they really want to kiss you but are uncertain about your consent so they hesitate in making the first move: that perfectly defines cute. They just sit there nervously looking at you with a question mark on their face. The fact that they are being shy and care about our response makes it ten times cuter. Absolute surety is not always attractive.    40 Things Men Find Attractive About Women 8 Things Your Girlfriend Wants To Say But She Is Too Afraid 11 Things You Never Knew Men Find Most Disgusting These content links are provided by Content.ad.

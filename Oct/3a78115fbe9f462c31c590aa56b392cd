Another picture of the same inmate hugging and kissing a different woman on the cheek has surfaced.Mzansi LIVE published the story and pictures of the inmate and the warder hugging and kissing at Losperfontein Correctional Facility in Brits, North West.  But the young prison warder ended her life when the pictures were made public. Tshidi Mapole, spokeswoman for the department of correctional services in Limpopo, Mpumalanga and the North West said the department knew about the images.

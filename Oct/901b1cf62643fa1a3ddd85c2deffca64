When you sleep in certain positions night after night, it leads to “sleep lines” — wrinkles that become etched into the top layers of skin and don’t fade once you’re up. Sleeping on your side leads to wrinkles on cheeks and chin, while sleeping face down gives you a furrowed brow. Salmon (along with other cold-water fish) is a great source of protein, one of the building blocks of great skin. It also has plenty of omega-3 fatty acids. Experts say essential fatty acids nourish skin and keep it plump and youthful, and that can help minimize wrinkles.

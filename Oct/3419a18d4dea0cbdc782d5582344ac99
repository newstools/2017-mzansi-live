Zwai’s cheating ways were allegedly exposed when Mel extracted cellphone records. The showbiz couple announced about two weeks ago that they were calling quits on their ten year marriage and failed to give reasons for the shock split. Sources have revealed that the reason behind the divorce was because Mel had caught Zwai cheating on three occasions. In one incident, it was shortly after she had given birth to their child. The pair share two children together. One source said Zwai’s actions were concerning as Mel often carried the family by taking care of their financial responsibilities as she had a stable job at Metro FM while Zwai had gigs here and there. Another source said the situation was bad and that Zwai’s family knew he was cheating. “He had no clue he would make such mistakes. And look where it got him,” an informant said.

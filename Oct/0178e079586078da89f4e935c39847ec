It is a belief amongst people that a star fell into the Soutpan mountains 1 000 years ago and gave it healing powers. Nowdays, hundreds of people regularly flock to the river near Mmotla in North West to wash off their bad luck and restore their hope in the future, as the water comes from the mountain. Believers travel miles from as far as Mpumalanga and Limpopo to wash in the holy water. Nyangas, sangomas, prophets and pastors believe the water that flows from the mountain brings good luck and heals the sick.  [Above] A man who was randomly captured praying at the River of Luck and Healing Prophet Moses Chihlangu from Tshwane was interviewed and said: “The water is powerful and pure. That’s what makes us come here often.” “Some of them want men, others want their businesses to flourish and others just want to succeed in life,” he said. He said he used to cleanse his clients at a river in Atteridgeville, Tshwane but he moved after several bodies were found there. A few metres from where the prophet and his clients were performing a cleansing ceremony, there were people collecting water in big containers. They believed washing with the water and drinking it could be cleanse them.   Maria Somo, who was collecting water, said: “I used to have problems with my feet but now they are healed. It’s all about belief.” Another happy believer said a tokoloshe had harassed her for years but after using the water, she could live in peace.

When we love narcissistic or abusive people, sometimes the way we see ourselves becomes warped. Instead of seeing the good, the strong, the beautiful, we see what our abusers see—unworthiness. And we learn, through mistreatment, to accept that negativity as our identity. But the way someone sees you—especially when their perception is skewed, broken, or plain wrong—does not define you. You are more than their words and actions. You are more than what you’ve been conditioned to believe. You are more than the hate they have thrown at you, physically or emotionally or in any way they have. You are not what they think/say/believe you are. Only you can create and embody an identity. Choose to lift and free yourself from their chains. You may have been under someone’s tight grip for so long. You may feel a heaviness over your shoulders that you can’t seem to shake. You may be so exhausted, so tired, so weak. But what matters is not where you’ve been or what you’ve gone through. What matters is what you do next. What matters is how you choose to stand, to rise, to step. What matters is where you go, from this moment on. Choose to believe. Choose to fight. Choose to heal.

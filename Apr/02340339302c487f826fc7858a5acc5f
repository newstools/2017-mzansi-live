In order to analyze the dreams we must also study how we participate in our daily activities.Are dreams a replay on the visual stimuli of what we perceive in waking hours or messages of guidance from beyond? What do these symbols mean? How do we interpret them and analyze them to give us messages?Dreams of flying often indicate the need to reach ambition. Where are you going? How are you getting there? Are you having trouble navigating through life? Flying dreams tend to leave us recharged when we wake.There is a feeling of freedom and being able to accomplish anything in our way.&nbsp;

In an interview with Anele Mdoda on Real Talk, Somizi admitted that while he bought his house cash, he once had a car repossesed.&#8220;The more richer I become, the more I have so much to lose,&#8221; he said during the interview.When Anele said that he is the most famous person in South Africa at the moment, Somizi agreed&#8230; humbly.&#8220;You are correct. When you walk into a room and anyone, no matter their race, age and sexuality they go gaga, then you know.&#8221;However, Somizi himself admitted that between 2006 and 2009 times were tough.&#8220;I ain&#8217;t going back there. Nevar. Evar. In the name of Jesus. I had one car repossessed but I have never been careless. I had to sell my house and use the money to rent.&#8221;&nbsp;

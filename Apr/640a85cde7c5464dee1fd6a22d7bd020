&nbsp;An armoured vehicle stationed at the Gupta compound belongs to the family and is being used for &#8220;safety purposes&#8221;, family attorney Gert van der Merwe has told MzansiLIVE.Deputy Managing Director of Sahara Computers, Gary Naidoo last week denied the presence of an armoured vehicle on the Saxonwold property altogether, contradicting the family attorney&#8217;s more recent admission that the vehicle is owned by the Guptas and held on the property for security purposes.The vehicle strongly resembles the Griffin armoured vehicle manufactured by Scipio Technologies in Boksburg, a Rapport investigation has shown. Scipio is registered with the National Conventional Arms Control Committee (NCACC), a statutory body responsible for the regulation of trade of conventional arms. The company is consequently permitted to manufacture armoured vehicles only for military and not private use.Scipio markets the defense vehicle as an &#8220;extremely flexible and agile battlefield tool&#8221; that can be &#8220;configured as per client preferences to a simple armoured personel carrier or as an effective wheeled combat vehicle&#8221;.Two security guards at the Gupta Saxonwold mansion who have requested to remain anonymous told MzansiLIVE that the military vehicle will be used to beef up security.&#8221; We were told that the police nolonger provides us with the expected security level as desired due to the intensity of the protests hence we will use the vehicle whenever necessary. I urge protesters never to provoke the security here because we have been instructed to be violent and even kill whenever we feel threatened.A lot is happening here a lot of looting and government officials are coming here some on Fridays only but some come every month end. This is the kind of talk that get us fired here,&#8221; he said.

I don t care if you just drowned in Chipotle and are facing the awful repercussions. Keep that sh*t to yourself (literally).There is nothing less attractive than sharing your B-room habits with your boyfriend. I don t care how comfortable you think you are with one another. That sh*t grosses him out EVERY SINGLE TIME.If you think he s entertaining your comments about said bathroom habits, he s just being nice, trying to tune you out and praying to all that is holy that you will STFU instead of delving deeper into your story.&nbsp;

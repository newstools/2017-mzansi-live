 Mathe defended Amakhosi when asked if the players they sign are good enough to play for the clubFormer Kaizer Chiefs defender Brian Mathe feels the club&#8217;s transfer policy has unfairly been criticised.The signings Amakhosi have brought in over the past two seasons in particular, have not been delivering the goods. The likes of Siphelele Mthembu, Edward Manqele, Bongani Ndulula and Sula Matovu are some of the names who failed to live up to expectations at the club.He admitted that playing for Chiefs is different from playing for other PSL teams, suggesting that pressure could be one of the reasons why some players find it hard to produce their best performances at Naturena. I can&#8217;t say to Chiefs or the fans that they are right to say that some of their signings have not been convincing. At the same time, being an analyst and a former Chiefs player I know how difficult it is to play for Chiefs, Mathe told MzaniLIVE Any player who comes to them has been good at their club, but it is always difficult to play for Chiefs, (Orlando) Pirates and (Mamelodi) Sundowns because the expectations are quite high for some players, Mathe said. A lot of the players Chiefs have signed have been doing well at their respective clubs. I don t think there s a player they have signed that has not been doing well at their previous club.&#8221; When they signed Chirambadare, he was doing well at his club. Whether or not he is the type of player that is suitable for Chiefs is another thing. So, I can only say it s always tough to play for Chiefs, Mathe concluded.&nbsp;

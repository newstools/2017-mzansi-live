Donald Trump and his administration has jumped into South African politics backing Democratic Alliance s call to push a vote of no confidence on embattled President Jacob Zuma and hinted on sanctions imposed on Jacob Zuma.United States Secretary of State Rex Wayne Tillerson made the call from the White House through a statement. Jacob Zuma is an example we want to erase autocracy from administration of governments. He is following Robert Mugabe s footsteps and we will not tolerate that. After consultation with the President, we have resolved to sanction President Zuma until he listens to the will of the people.

The ANC has not yet responded to the developments partly because they are also disgruntled by the recent actions taken by President Zuma of firing Cabinet Ministers most notable being the Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.

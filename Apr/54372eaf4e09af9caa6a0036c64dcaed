The veteran midfielder, who has had limited game time in recent seasons, says he has decided to seek a new challenge elsewhere before retiring from the game after two seasons. My contract with Sundowns expires this season, and to be fair, I have served them with flying colours and have won many things, but I m looking for a new challenge, Modise told Sun Sport. I still have the passion for football and I want more game-time. It s time to move on and retire somewhere in a completely new environment. Sundowns will understand as well, it s nothing personal. I m expensive but happy to take a pay cut. The 34-year-old midfielder also revealed that he would retire after two seasons to focus on his businesses. I will retire from football in two seasons to focus on my business. Football has taken so much of my time, but I hope I won t be lost in the game because I want to plough back to the community through the sport. Modise started his professional football career at Ria Stars in 2001.The veteran midfielder has also played for City Pillars, SuperSport United and Orlando Pirates in his illustrious career.&nbsp;

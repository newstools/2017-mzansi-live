Open your eyes!Don t believe the naysayers. It s perfectly plausible for a man and a woman to be friends without there being any romantic or sexual connection. There are plenty of cases of very healthy relationships between men and women that don t revolve around romantic love or sex. However, there is a very fine line between being just a friend and being something just a little bit more. As ladies, you shouldn t act like the crazy girlfriend who wouldn t allow her man to have female friends. But you should also keep vigilant and be very wary of those girl friends who might just be a little too friendly.A lot of these girls will have some ulterior motives with regards to their friendship with your man and you can t always be too trusting. They might want to steal him away from you or maybe lure him into a night of fun in the bedroom without your consent. If you see that your man s friend is guilty of a few of the items on this list, then it is time for you to take action and have a little talk with your guy.You have flirted with him before. You know what it looks like. So whenever you notice that this girl is flirting with your man, then you should really take action. Nobody gets to flirt with your man except you. Also, if she s flirting with your man, then it s highly likely that she isn t just a friend .&nbsp;

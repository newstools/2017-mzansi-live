Depression is not something that people can just choose to have or get rid of.Depression can be such a slippery slope especially for people who are generally ignorant or misinformed about this mental illness. This is a phenomenon that has managed to damage the lives of so many people, and yet, a huge bulk of individuals still carry false perspectives on the issue. Depression can be found even in the most unlikely of people and we must always tread lightly around them. We must always practice full compassion and empathy for these people. We have to be sensitive of their feelings and know that whatever we say or do can greatly affect them.Depression is not something that people can just choose to have or get rid of. There isn t a switch that you can flip up or down. Depression isn t something that you can turn off whenever it gets uncomfortable. No one ever chooses to become depressed. Depression comes even when you don t expect, and if you re not strong enough, it can consume your entire being. So it doesn t make sense for you to just tell people with depression to look on the bright side and expect them to follow you.&nbsp;&nbsp;

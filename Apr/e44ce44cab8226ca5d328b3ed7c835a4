South Africa woke up to surprise news on Friday morning about massive cabinet reshuffle, which received mixed feelings among citizens and all political parties.South Africans took it to twitter to poke former Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula who was newly appointed Minister of Police. Twitter has it that Minister Fikile Mbalula has ordered thousands of Timberland boots for his police personnel so that they can match their Ministers taste of fashion.This did not come as a surprise since the EFF leader Julius Malema in his #cabinet reshuffle press conference on Friday claims that Mbalula will hire American diva Beyonc to perform for the police.&nbsp;

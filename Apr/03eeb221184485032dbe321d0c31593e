Peeling feet is definitely common, and there are various reasons whyWe&#8217;re on our feet all the time and the constant pounding and walking can cause cracking and scaling of the skin, But peeling feet can be about more than just pounding the pavement.Here are seven reasons why your feet might be peeling.The most common reason patients have peeling feet is a fungal infection (like athlete&#8217;s foot) although they might not always realize it. A lot of times it just presents itself as peeling skin and patients don&#8217;t have the itchiness, so they don&#8217;t know it&#8217;s a fungal infection.So if your skin starts mysteriously peeling all of a sudden, get it checked out sooner rather than later. Once you have a fungal infection on your skin, it can easily infect your toenail, which can be very difficult to get rid of.&nbsp;&nbsp;

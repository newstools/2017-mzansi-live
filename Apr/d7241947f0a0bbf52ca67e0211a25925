We know it s not that deep, considering South Africa has more serious issues right now, such as Khanyi Mbau s pink skin and Nasty C s Female Artist of the Year nomination at the Samas, but Rebecca Malope and SABC1 s show Friends Like These are the reasons people have trust issues.Though she has mentioned this a long time ago, so many South Africans did not know that Rebecca is a stage name. One Twitter user has caused a stir after somehow finding out that the gospel legend s real name is Batsogile Lovederia Malope.Now people on Twitter say they feel betrayed by this revelation . However, some are having none of it as they say they don t recognise Batsogile. I bet even God knows her as Rebecca Malope not Batsogile Lovederia Malope, one said, while others questioned if our country is even called South Africa.Another fan was faced with a dilemma after revealing she had named her child after Rebecca. What must happen now?Check out some of the reactions on Twitter below:@tshepo_hope1 @gigi_gao_ I named my daughter Rebecca because of her. eish now I must change her name.&mdash; Africa ke ya Rona (@mangaung73) April 20, 2017@gigi_gao_ I&#39;m soo hurt right now pic.twitter.com/XYlTQVzV0f&mdash; Godfather (@irvin_stunna) April 20, 2017So Rebecca Malope is a stage name? pic.twitter.com/WuRNZBYcKT&mdash; Geegee Rantie (@gigi_gao_) April 19, 2017

Kaizer Chiefs coach Steve Komphela if finally seeing the light at the Glamour Boys after a difficult start, which at some point saw the club fans questioning if whether he was still the right man to lead the Soweto giants.In his first season with the club, Komphela lead Chiefs to a fifth place finish having accumulated 46 points after 30 matches, at the moment, the club is on third place with 39 points, just three points behind log leaders Cape Town City with eight games before the end of the season.The club has had a decent campaign to that of last, however, Komphela feels he can t celebrate yet with the team yet to achieve anything. I personally think some of the things that we have been addressing are starting to come through, but we haven t achieved anything. It is not good enough, you still need to win 30 matches and somebody must win 29, then you achieved at Chiefs, said the Amakhosi coach. I hardly celebrate even after scoring, because nothing has been achieved. I don t know, maybe I have been through a lot of setbacks. I don t celebrate a lot because the minute you start celebrating is the end.

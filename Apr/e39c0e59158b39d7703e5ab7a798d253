To a lot of women, image is everything. How they appear to the outside world matters greatly when it comes to determining their self-worth.They hold a mild belief that their life s value will increase if other people will place them up on a pedestal and revel at their prowess. Women are very proud creatures, and it would absolutely bug them to know that their reputations don t live up to their personal standards.Another reason, aside from being proud, why women are very meticulous about their reputation is that they never want to give other people an excuse to humiliate or judge them. They never want to be on the receiving end of someone s negative comment.And because women place so much importance in the image that they project to the public, they will have tendencies to distort that image. They will try to manipulate that image the best way they can to portray the highest possible versions of themselves that they can show.That is why a lot of women will resort to mild (or sometimes even grand) dishonesty just to show the outside world that they are better than they appear. Here are some of the most common things that women lie about.There is no denying the importance of money in the world. These days, a person s success is more often than not directly tied to how much money that person makes.So it s definitely no wonder why some women will resort to bloating their financial numbers up a little bit in an effort to impress other people. But you should know that this isn t the only reason women would lie about how much they make.In these modern times, a lot of women are gaining more traction and even earning way more money than their male counterparts.In an effort to not bruise their boyfriends egos, some women will resort to lying how much money they make. She would never want her boyfriend to feel like a lesser man just because she earns more money than him.&nbsp;

A new law in India could see WhatsApp group administrators jailed for messages sent on their watch.People who have false, offensive or misleading information in their groups will be held accountable for them. This is in a move to combat fake news in Vanarasi.The new rules were set out in a joint order by District Magistrate Yogeshwar Ram Mishra and Senior Superintendent of Police Nitin Tiwari.In the far reaching order admins will be expected to monitor all content and should false, offensive, inaccurate information make its way into the group, the person should be notified, removed followed by a report to the police.If not, they will be held responsible and they could end up in the can.While we are keen on a clampdown on fake news, this does feel eerily creepy. Cops looking into your phones to make sure you behave is just plain, proper weird. We know privacy is a myth for many but good grief this takes two cups and a step ladder.Mind you social media is not bound by district so . erm it might get a bit testy.We hope we have not given our lot here ideas. Zimbabwe has a new cyber law on its way and some smart alec might decide to sneak it in there.

Robert and the minister were convinced into talking about their differences during a &#8216;sit down&#8217; set up by music veteran Oskido, who is a personal friend to both of them.Speaking to MzansiLIVE, Oskido confirmed that Robert and Fikile met on Monday night, and resolved their differences.&#8220;They are both my best friends and I decided to call them for a meeting and they agreed so everything went well. So Fikile and Marawa (Robert) are buddies, no more fighting,&#8221; Oskido said.Oskido also shared a picture of the police minister and Robert shaking hands.&#8220;Conflicts and fights are a result of a failure to sit down and talk. This often leads to undesirable drama. It&#8217;s good to see two people I hold highly, @robert_marawa and Minister of Police, hug and make up after talking,&#8221; Oskido said in his caption.Robert also took to Twitter to share that they had quashed the beef and thanked Oskido for the intervention.We met. We spoke. We resolved. We shook hands. Thank you @OskidoIBelieve for the intervention.

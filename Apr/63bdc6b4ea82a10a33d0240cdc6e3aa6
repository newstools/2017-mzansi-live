Even though singer has been in the industry he&#8217;s tried to keep his personal life away from the spotlight, and has focused on feeding fans &#8220;good music&#8221;.Well during a chat with MzansiLIVE, we got Ntando to let down the guard and spill the beans on some of those &#8216;hidden secrets&#8217;.Who was your first crush?&#8220;A girl called Sharon. She was a classmate of mine in primary (school). I was so afraid to tell her I like her but I did, eventually&#8230; after a long time.Tell us about your first kiss &#8230;&#8220;It was with a girl named Sibongile. She was my first girlfriend&#8221;Your all-time celebrity crush&#8230;&#8220;Rihanna. I think there is something very ghetto about her, some &#8216;kasi&#8217; vibe that I like. So ya, I kinda like Rihanna but Drake took care of that *laughs*.&#8221;How did you spend your first pay cheque? &#8220;I actually saved it. I wanted a car so bad, so I didn&#8217;t even touch it, besides it wasn&#8217;t much.&#8221;What would you do if you were given a million right now? &#8220;Why not a billion? Okay&#8230; I would use the million to help develop and promote other talented artists&#8221;Describe Ntando in three words&#8230;&#8220;Simple, kind-hearted and I think I am funny&#8221;&nbsp;

Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) national spokesperson Mbuyiseni people s bae Ndlozi has opened up about his personal life in a hilarious interview with T-Bose on Kaya FM on Friday.Ndlozi said he grew up in a female-dominated house, with his grandmother and mother, who he described as his maker because she educated him. Just like his party s CIC Julius Malema, he respects his grandmother because she taught him discipline. If you want me to bow to order, bring my grandmother up, he told T-Bose.The people s bae , as he is affectionately known by South Africans, said he did not know where the name came from, urging T-Bose to ask Black Twitter as they came up with it. He has tried to keep his distance from the name, to no avail.Though he has been nationalised, he told T-Bose that he has a partner and, from the sound of it, he is very much in love. However, there might be hope a little bit as he said we ll see about that , when asked if polygamy was an option to accommodate the many people who have a crush on him.Though he said the women in parliament were too old for him to have a crush on, Ndlozi said he could have had a great crush on speaker of parliament Baleka Mbete, but she got married before it could happen.Here are a few things we learnt about Ndlozi from the interview:He doesn t take power naps either because the revolution is demanding, though he said he was shocked when he saw that naps were a culture in parliament. One of the cultural shocks that I associated for the longest of time was the amount of sleeping that happens in parliament. It actually was horrific to watch and parliament starts at 2pm, and 6pm, it s done, mara eh yah. Even Zuma sleeps during a debate of his own speech. He s not aware and then he passes out. It s exhausting I guess.

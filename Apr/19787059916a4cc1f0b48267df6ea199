A Somouhoro own goal late in the second half blew the title race wide as Amakhosi moved up to second on the log on SaturdayA comedy of errors in the opening stages of the game left both sets of fans frustrated in the stands, but Bangaly Soumahoro s own goal frustrated the Mamelodi Sundowns fans even more as Kaizer Chiefs claimed a crucial 2-1 home win.The defending champions were first to open the scoring through Khama Billiat in the 26th minute, but Bernard Parker pulled Amakhosi level with a sublime finish 15 minutes before the interval.It was Soumahoro s own goal that gifted the home side all the points on the night, lifting them to second on the table with 39 points from 22 league games.The result left saw Sundowns remain in fifth position, but what s more worrying is that Pitso Mosimane hasn t won any of his last four league games, and his team hasn t been able to turn their games in hand into maximum points.Mosimane made changes to his starting line-up, and as expected, he threw Billiat onto the pitch, and handed Anthony Laffor a rare start upfront.Steve Komphela on the other hand, kept faith with his tried and tested, with George Lebese again settling for a place on the bench.The match kicked off at a blistering pace, with Sundowns threatening early on, but Chiefs were not in the mood as their defense kept their calm to stop the likes of Percy Tau and Billiat upfront.Despite a number of good goalscoring chances, both teams failed to put the ball into the back of the net, making life very difficult for themselves that was expected though after a two-week break due to international football.Chiefs created better goalscoring chances compared to their Tshwane opponents, with Siphiwe Tshabalala coming close in the 16th minute, but Kennedy Mweene produced a good save.Eric Mathoho should have done better two minutes later, but the lanky defender failed to hit the target as he directed his header from a Tshabalala free-kick wide of goal.Komphela s men were made to rue the missed chances when Billiat expertly brought the ball down on the edge of the box, selling Lorenzo Gordinho a dummy in the process, before beating itumeleng Khune with a deflected shot to make it 1-0 to the Brazilians.The goal angered the Amakhosi players, and they threw numbers forward. They were rewarded for the persistent pressure as Edmore Chirambadare caught the Sundowns defense napping on the right hand side of the box before playing the ball to Parker to make it 1-1.A few chances were created in the final 15 minutes of the first half, but both teams were happier to knock the ball around with no intent to go forward.The start of the second half was exhilarating, with both fans singing and chanting in trying to encourage their respective trams to push forward and add to the scoreboard.Sundowns looked threatening at times, but Themba Zwane wasted two glorious opportunities in a very short space of time as Chiefs were found wanting in defense.The speedy winger dribbling his way into the Amakhosi box, only to be denied by Khune, who read the danger before quickly coming off his line to make a good save.Zwane found himself alone in the small box a few minutes later, but the midfielder fired wide.At this stage, Chiefs looked out of depth, but they never stopped trying and Komphela should be applauded for the two changes he made to reignite the spark.George Lebese and Gustavo Paez made immediate impact after coming on for Chirambadare and Parker respectively.Paez put Bangaly Soumahoro under immense pressure in the closing stages of the game, and the Ivorian defender unintentionally put the ball into his own net, after failing check the position of his keeper Mweene for a back pass.Sundowns didn t recover after that own goal, and they were often left red-faced by Amakhosi s resolute defending.

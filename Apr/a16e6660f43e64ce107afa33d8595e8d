The muso has decided to venture into the hair business and told TshisaLIVE that she is hoping to launch a range of weaves by the end of the year.She said that she was inspired to start the business after receiving tons of enquires about her hair.&#8220;I usually buy two boxes of weaves and many people have stopped me to compliment the texture and ask where I get my weaves from. So, I decided to start my own weave brand since everybody is madly in love with my hair,&#8221; she revealed.The Peruvian and Brazilian weaves will all be imported but will be sold at a price that most of her fans can afford.&#8220;The weaves come in 8,10,12,14,16,18 and 20 inch options and can even be coloured without damaging the hair. Normally Brazilian and Peruvian pieces cost over R4,000 but mine will be very reasonable and affordable to everyone,&#8221; she said.Babes will sell the range online and is confident that her fans will snap up the merchandise.Now, if only she could get bra Hugh Masekela to buy a box.&nbsp;

A lot of times, when we get caught in bad relationships, we are left with an internal struggle. We are forced to reexamine what we really want out of the relationship.We have to decide whether the relationship is still something worth saving and fighting for or if it s just one of those scenarios where it s better to just walk away. We are always taught that we have to fight hard for the things we want the most, but sometimes, we also have to know when we should just walk away.While it can be difficult to just give general advice to relationships that carry very specific and intimate details, there are just some universal principles in this matter that everyone should know about.If you manage to find yourself in a relationship with these kinds of characteristics, then perhaps you should seriously consider just walking away from it all.You should never feel insecure about who you are when you are in a relationship. The best and most successful kinds of relationships are the one wherein partners lift each other up and build each other s confidence.You should never have to second-guess your character in a healthy relationship with someone.Your partner should be giving you lots of confidence and joy.&nbsp;

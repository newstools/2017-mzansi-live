According to data from cheating website Victoria Milan, 47.3% of men internationally have made use of s.x workers, and 23.3% are regulars &#8211; engaging &#8220;ladies of the night&#8221; at least once a week.It is pertinent to note that this cannot be extrapolated to men in general, but only of the men who form part of the cheating website&#8217;s subscribers.The data, compiled from the site&#8217;s 6 097 male members showed that 35% of men who use s.x workers do not enjoy the experience; rather do it out of &#8220;necessity&#8221;.The main reason men pay for s.x is the unavailability of a partner &#8211; 40.1% of men fell into this category &#8211; but 36.% used s.x workers to live out fantasies that the they could not with their current long-term partner.In terms of price, Victoria Milan said that men paid an average of 50 &#8211; 200 (R710 &#8211; R2840) or about 2 000 (R28 398) per year for a regular customer.However, there are wild swings in price throughout the world.According to black market pricing index Havocscope, the cost for a s.x worker in India can range from $1 (R13) for an adult to $1 000 (R13 000) for a virgin (read: underage girl).However, the rate in Germany is a flat $65 (R858) and a union minimum of $100 (R1321) in Switzerland. In the UK, a street s.x worker can cost about $20 (R264).In SA, The Citizen reported that a Johannesburg s.x worker makes between R3 000 and R4 000 a month, charging R100 for straight s.x.Advocacy group SWEAT estimates that there are between 31 000 and 94 000 s.x workers in Gauteng, with the majority being black South African women and a significant percentage from Zimbabwe.A Stellenbosch University Master&#8217;s thesis by Ferdinand Chemungha Mukumbang suggests that 1.51% of the adult female population in SA are involved in the s.x trade.The cheating website found that 80% of men will book a s.x worker for one hour to &#8220;get it over and done with as quickly as possible&#8221;.And 50.1% of men find the experience unsatisfying because the prostitute &#8220;lacked enthusiasm&#8221;, and 26.3% said the escort was less attractive than her picture suggested.&nbsp;&nbsp;

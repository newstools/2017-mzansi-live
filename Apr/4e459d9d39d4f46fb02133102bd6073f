Bongekile Babes Wodumo Simelane has announced that she is single, though she may not be available for the masses who fought to have her declared a national treasure.Without revealing who the lucky man was, Babes Wodumo once said in an interview that she was engaged, though she left Mzansi wondering if it was Mampintsha.To date, the two have not responded to speculations despite being seen in public together and Babes Wodumo sharing sweet messages about Mampintsha on social media.The bad news is that Babes Wodumo already has an eye on someone, as she said on Instagram: I m single, but I know who I want. I&#39;m single but I know who I want.A post shared by Bongekile Simelane (@babes_wodumo) on Apr 24, 2017 at 9:44am PDTSome were excited over the news, saying they would submit their CVs to try their luck, while others did not, for a second, believe her announcement.She was posing alone in that picture, but she was not alone in real life, they said.On who she wanted, Cassper Nyovest, who is also single and has been working with Babes Wodumo, seemed to have been most people s best guess.Only time will tell if she really is single and if Cassper is the lucky guy.

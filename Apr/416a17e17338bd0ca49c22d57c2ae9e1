Skhumba Hlophe may be a funny guy, but he allegedly learned the hard way that featuring on Bonang Queen B Matheba s radio show was no joke.This as the comedian was allegedly given the cold shoulder by the radio and TV personality this week, when he showed up for an interview. Skhumba was so excited about being interviewed on The Front Row, he even showed up at SABC s Metro FM studios ahead of time, an insider said. He was so looking forward to the interview, he spent the whole night before preparing for the show. But sources claimed when he showed up for his dream moment, Queen B felt he wasn t good enough and demanded someone better.The source claimed: Skhumba was crushed after being told what Bonang had said. He was told the interview would no longer happen. A third informant said Skhumba had already told his friends and posted on social media he d be interviewed on Metro. I can imagine what a beating his ego took, the source said. It s unclear why Skhumba was turned down. Maybe he made a joke about Queen B. A sympathiser said: We all know his road to success has been a bumpy ride. The poor guy from the dusty streets of Tembisa is trying to earn a living. For him to be told he s not goood enough for Metro FM is a big blow below the belt. Skhumba refused to comment on the matter.His manager, Sindy Mnguni, said he was to have an interview with Metro. He called me to say there s no longer an interview, but didn t give me reasons why the interview was cancelled, she said.Bonang could not be reached for comment.

EFF leader Julius Malema says some ANC members have been misleading the masses about South Africa being downgraded to junk status to protect President Jacob Zuma.JOHANNESBURG Opposition parties say Wednesday s mass action to the Union Buildings marks the beginning of a consciousness movement aimed at educating ordinary South Africans about the consequences of being downgraded to junk status by rating agencies.During a joint briefing in Pretoria on Monday, the parties including the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), Democratic Alliance (DA), Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) and United Democratic Movement (UDM) announced they have been granted permission to march to the seat of government.Last Friday saw thousands of people across the country take part in anti-Zuma demonstrations while others came out in support of the president.EFF leader Julius Malema says some ANC members have been misleading the masses about South Africa being downgraded to junk status to protect President Zuma. This leadership must not take advantage of people not knowing what a junk status is and say it s nothing; that s misleading. He says citizens, especially the poor, must be educated about the implications. Our people will not understand, we know that we were denied education and we may not understand what a junk status is. The EFF leader says the only way the country can rebuild its ailing economy is by Zuma stepping down.Meanwhile, the DA s Phumzile van Damme says she hopes ANC MPs will act in the interest of the country in next week s motion of no confidence against the president. We hope if they don t listen to us, they ll listen to the people who have put them in office. Following concerns of safety and disruptions, Malema has warned pro-Zuma activists to stay away from Wednesday s march.

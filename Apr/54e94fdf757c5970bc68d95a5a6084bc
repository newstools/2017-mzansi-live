Speaking at a press conference held in Hlaudi&#8217;s honour on Wednesday, Doc Shebeleza defended the 90 percent local music quota introduced by Hlaudi at the SABC.In his remarks, he said that artists and radio personalities at the station such as Robert Marawa and former Metro FM DJ Bonang Matheba had benefited from the policy and should thank Hlaudi for their success.&#8220;If someone makes the right decision (for you), you should acknowledge them. You have the radio presenters, Robert Marawa, Bonang Matheba, they are not here to say thank you (to Hlaudi). Why? The ones who are benefiting are not here. There is something wrong there. They are benefiting because of you,&#8221; he said, pointing to Hlaudi.A Twitter user alerted Robert to the comments, only for the sports presenter to hit back by challenging Doc Shebeleza.@Allan_Tshuma @bonang_m Tell that Doc Shebeleza to come to MetroFM Studios at 6pm and tell me that nonsense to my face!!&mdash; robertmarawa (@robertmarawa) April 19, 2017Robert did not entertain the conversation further, choosing to respond to comments about his Metro FM show instead.NzansiLIVE&#8217;s repeated attempts to contact Robert for additional comment were unsuccessful.Hlaudi was said to have come to Robert&#8217;s rescue last year after the sports presenter was reprimanded by Metro FM bosses for comments he had made on his radio show.According to Sunday World, the star was summoned to a meeting by the station&#8217;s management to answer to the complaints the station had received against his show. Hlaudi told the paper that he had called the bosses to order and told them that they should &#8220;not entertain gossip about their colleagues&#8221;.

Sometimes, we might find ourselves in the middle of a relationship, when something just doesn t feel right, it feels like something is missing but you can t quite figure out what it is, here are some ways you can tell a healthy relationship from one that is unhealthy.When you re in a healthy relationship, all you want to do is give your loved one everything and anything it takes to make them happy, without expecting anything in return.It is true that relationships are built on give and take, but that happens when both people give selflessly, it is not a business deal where you invest and expect profit in return, the right balance is created when both people give freely and selflessly, there s no price to be paid or expected.&nbsp;

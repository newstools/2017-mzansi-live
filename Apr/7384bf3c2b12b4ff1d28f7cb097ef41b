#1 A man who can respect herThis may seem easy to do, but do you really respect your wife or girlfriend?Most guys always consider themselves to be know-it-alls and assume they re better than their woman in every way. If you think your woman s nothing but a sexy arm candy, how can you ever respect her?Respect has to be earned, yes, but unless you truly believe that your woman has some great qualities and is even better than you in some aspects, you can never ever respect her. Learn to respect the woman in your life, and she ll love you and respect you a lot more too.&nbsp;

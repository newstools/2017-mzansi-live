It turns out that having a little &#8220;junk in the trunk&#8221; is a good thing, health wise. Not only does having a larger derriere boost overall health, but it&#8217;s tied to increased intelligence and lower risk of chronic disease, according to researchers at the University of Oxford and Churchill Hospital in the United Kingdom.Fat distribution is important, say researchers, and if you&#8217;re going to have some, it&#8217;s best to have it below the waist, as it helps to serve as a barrier against heart disease, diabetes and other conditions linked to obesity.&#8220;It is the protective role of lower body, that is [thigh and backside] fat, that is striking. The protective properties of the lower-body fat depot have been confirmed in many studies conducted in subjects with a wide range of age, BMI and co-morbidities,&#8221; scientists wrote in the Journal of Obesity.Maintaining a larger behind requires significant amounts of Omega 3 fats, which are proven to boost brain function, memory and cognitive abilities. Research also shows that children born to women with wide hips are more intelligent compared to those conceived by thinner and less curvy mothers.&nbsp;

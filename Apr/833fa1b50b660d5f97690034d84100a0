I might have made the comments at the time not realising the damage I am causing to everyone. My behaviour was extremely inappropriate, immature, and lacked the respect you deserve.Hence I request you to accept my sincere apologies. I hope that we can put this matter behind us. I look forward to work with you and learning again.RegardsM.

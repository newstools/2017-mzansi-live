It seems the public broadcaster is running out of money and struggling to pay top soapies such as Muvhango, Isidingo and Uzalo.The shows are all commissioned by the SABC and air on SABC 2, 3 and 1. According to a report by Sunday Sun, the SABC has dire financial woes as the production company Endemol which produces Isidingo, wasn t paid last month.Uzalo only received a portion of their scheduled payment while 7de Laan and Muvhango were not paid at all.The chief financial officer of the SABC Audrey Raphela wrote a letter advising production companies and those awaiting payment that the public broadcaster would honour its payment commitments by April 7. We are unable to pay our workers, who include presenters, actors and people who work behind the scenes, a source said. We ve been hearing the same song from the SABC since last year. Those people can t keep their promises, another source told the weekly.

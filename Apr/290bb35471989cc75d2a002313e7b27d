Lebese came off the bench to net the winner in the 85th minute.The win took Amakhosi to second spot on the log. They are level on 45 points with leaders Cape Town City after 23 league matches. We made a few changes, including bringing on George Lebese and it worked, Komphela told the club s website. With Edmore having worked hard in the first half, we thought that Lebese with his finesse will give us something different. And, I remember telling the bench that George will score for us tonight and that s exactly what happened. Komphela has admitted that every point counts in the final matches of the season. Every point counts at the stage. We played a good side that can hurt you if you aren t careful. They don t threaten often, but they have this ability to score at any point of the game if you aren t careful. We had to grind out a result and I m happy with the three points. The game was a spectacle for the supporters. Ironically, Chiefs next league match is against co-leaders City in Cape Town on Tueday, April 25.

Which of these lies have you been told?Let s face the truth. People lie on a daily basis. Probably, somewhere in the world right now, someone is telling a lie. But why do we do it? Why are we virtually incapable of practicing 100% unadulterated honesty? Well, it can be difficult to generalize. People lie for completely different reasons every day. Some people tell lies to protect other people from the harsh realities of the truth. Other people lie as a means to get themselves out of trouble. A few people lie just for the sake of causing destruction and creating confusion. Whatever the case, it s almost for certain that people absolutely hate being lied to.When it comes to dating, we always demand complete honesty from the people we re with. We don t want to ever be blindsided when it comes to love and romance. That s why we always want to make sure that we re seeing the whole picture; that we re not kept in the dark about anything. However, it s important for you to know that people constantly lie to each other even in relationships. Especially in the early parts of a relationship wherein a person just wants to come off as something close to perfect, it can become very easy to lie. So when you re going out for someone for the first time, it would be safe to assume that that person won t be completely honest with you right away. Here are the most common things people lie about on the first date.Obviously, sexual experience wouldn t be a comfortable topic for one to bring up during a first date. That s why whenever the conversation manages to hover around this area, people will tend to distort the truth the best way that they can. This isn t a usual first-date-conversation material, and so it s perfectly reasonable for people to lie about their sexual experiences. This is a sensitive area and not many people are comfortable with talking about it.&nbsp;

In 2014 Bonang&#8217;s contract with Metro FM was terminated after she signed a deal with rival pay-TV station SuperSport, a move that had not been approved by the SABC.It was revealed at the time that Bonang&#8217;s parents personally went to then COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng in an attempt to keep her job.The broadcaster issued a statement explaining that Bonang had apologised and withdrew all of her public statements on the issue.But will she be that lucky this time around?Nah, say sources.&#8220;Hlaudi protected her. He&#8217;s gone and the current management don&#8217;t sit for that kind of drama. There have been many other issues that have been overlooked and this lie of her saying nobody tried to contact her about the changes to the show was just the final straw,&#8221; explained a source.Bonang resigned on Monday and took to Twitter to say that she had only been informed of the changes an hour before her show. Lerato Kganyago was now going to be her co-host on Metro FM.&#8220;She said in her resignation letter that their brands don&#8217;t align. Does she think the SABC cares about her brand? No. Metro FM is a powerful brand and will continue without Bonang,&#8221; said another insider.Several well-placed sources have revealed that while Hlaudi may have given B a second chance, this time things will be different.&#8220;They (management) are tired of having lies told. There is no way that the station will be beholden to anyone, certainly not someone who lies. She may have grown up here and this is her home, but she&#8217;s been kicked out now. It&#8217;s done,&#8221; added another source.

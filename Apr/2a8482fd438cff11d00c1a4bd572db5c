Former African National Congress (ANC) MP Vytjie Mentor has opened a few files on what she thinks made President Jacob Zuma fire axed finance minister Pravin Gordhan. It seems the drama had nothing to do with the fake intelligence report, as suggested by EFF leaders Julius Malema and Floyd Shivambu.During Gordhan s presentation at the investor road show in London, there was a gentleman called Mr Chenkov who kept on asking many questions about South Africa, said Mentor.At the heart of his questions was whether the SA government was looking at developing nuclear energy. Without paying much thought into it, Gordhan apparently told the gentleman that government would never develop nuclear energy.This was apparently the response that decided Gordhan s fate, as Mr Chenkov did not ask further questions. After the presentation Mr Chenkov called someone and spoke in Russian, but whoever he was speaking to was not impressed and angrily dropped the phone. It is believed that this person immediately called Zuma and threatened him that if he does not immediately trigger the process of changing the finance minister and sign the Nuclear deal as commission has already been paid, he will be taught a lesson. A shaken Zuma immediately called the minister back home. You obviously know what happened! Now Gordhan has been sacked from his position and replaced with then home affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba. Mentor said Gigaba was rewarded for handing over the SAA route to India to the Gupta airline.Without revealing much about him, Mentor on Tuesday predicted on Facebook that a certain Buthelezi from KwaZulu-Natal would be appointed as finance minister. Well, she was not far off the mark, as he is the deputy minister.Mentor said if members of the top six did not act immediately, they would move from opposition benches to prison in 2019, further calling Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa a coward .

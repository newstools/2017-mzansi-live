Police spokesperson Captain Mavela Masondo confirmed to MzansiLIVE that the Ghanaian player was detained at Douglasdale Police Station on Monday. All I can confirm is that an Orlando Pirates player was arrested on charges of armed robbery. He appeared at the Randburg Magistrate s Court on Tuesday. At this stage I can t talk more about the case until I have all the details from the investigation officer, added Masondo.Earlier a daily publication reported that Morrison was arrested for stealing his own car.The publication reported that the Ghanaian footballer allegedly bought a car through an agent but the agent didn t pay the instalments to the car dealer.The car was repossessed by the dealer, but Morrison allegedly found a spare key and took the car back without the dealer s permission, but Masondo dismissed this story. I don t know who gave them that story, but it s not true. What I confirmed to them was that a player was arrested for robbery, nothing more, explained Masondo.

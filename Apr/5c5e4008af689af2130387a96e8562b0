Within a month or two of HIV entering the body, 40% to 90% of people experience flulike symptoms known as acute retroviral syndrome (ARS).But sometimes HIV symptoms don&#8217;t appear for years sometimes even a decade after infection.&#8220;In the early stages of HIV infection, the most common symptoms are none&#8221;. Three in five people in Africa with HIV doesn&#8217;t know they have it, which is why it&#8217;s so important to get tested, especially if you have unprotected s.x with more than one partner or use intravenous drugs.Here are some signs that you may be HIV-positive.One of the first signs of ARS can be a mild fever, up to about 102 degrees F.The fever, if it occurs at all, is often accompanied by other usually mild symptoms, such as fatigue, swollen lymph glands, and a sore throat.At this point the virus is moving into the blood stream and starting to replicate in large numbers. As that happens, there is an inflammatory reaction by the immune system.&nbsp;

Lesibe called his friend who stays in the same neighbourhood to assist.The friend identified as Thabiso went on to look for sangoma who could relieve the pair and save them from embarrassment.The sangoma did not succeed. The pair spent the whole day stuck. They hired another sangoma from Limpopo who arrived in the early hours of Tuesday, day two. The problem did not end as the Limpopo sangoma named Ingonyama failed to separate the adulterous couple.They finally swalloed their pride and called the husband to the woman who facilitated their release after paying a hefty fine.

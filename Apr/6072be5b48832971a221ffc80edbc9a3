JOHANNESBURG &#8211; Former African National Congress (ANC) treasurer general Mathews Phosa says he has accepted a nomination for the party s presidency to steer the ANC away from a dictatorship.This comes after the party s ward 52 in Cape Town nominated Phosa for ANC president on Saturday.Phosa says President Jacob Zuma showed autocracy during his controversial Cabinet reshuffle.He says a new collective leadership with similar visions for the party are needed, and should emerge during the upcoming elective conference in December. The president is a few steps away from being a dictator. If you look at how he handled the Cabinet reshuffle, he consulted himself&#8230; that s a step towards dictatorship and he could do many other things without consulting anyone.

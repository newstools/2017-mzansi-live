The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has written to speaker of parliament Baleka Mbete, asking that the motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma be postponed.This comes after the Constitutional Court granted the United Democratic Movement (UDM) an opportunity to argue in court why members of parliament (MPs) should be allowed to cast their ballots secretly during the vote of no confidence in the president.The EFF has requested Mbete to postpone the sitting for a date that will be decided after the court hearing of the UDM. The EFF holds a view that the outcomes of the Constitutional Court have a direct bearing on the possible nature and outcome of a motion of no confidence. We therefore make a rational request that the speaker must postpone the sitting of the 18th of April 2017 to a date that will be decided after the constitutional hearing and decision. UDM leader Bantu Holomisa took to Twitter to celebrate the success of his party in the Constitutional Court.SUCCESS! #UDM wins round one, #ConCourt will hear our application pic.twitter.com/FsFv9p6Kx6&mdash; Bantu Holomisa (@BantuHolomisa) April 11, 2017&nbsp;Parliament says that it has noted developments in the UDM application, and it will comply with the court this, of course, with parliament saying that the court has not made injunctions on the motion of no confidence debate. Parliament today received directions of the Constitutional Court in connection with the United Democratic Movement (UDM) application to have the motion of no confidence in the president conducted through a secret ballot. Parliament will comply with the directions and timeframes issued by the court. The Constitutional Court has not yet taken a decision to either hear or schedule the application of the UDM. No injunction has been made by the court regarding the debate on the motion of no confidence, which is scheduled for 18 April 2017 at 14h00 in the National Assembly.

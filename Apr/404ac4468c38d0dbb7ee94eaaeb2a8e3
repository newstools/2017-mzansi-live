&nbsp;I don t have exact percentages, but a large number of the male population suffers from the tragic Small Pen Syndrome (SPS for short.) Here are a few ways to tell (without actually having to witness his tiny pen.)&nbsp;This side effect pretty much encompasses the entire list, but can be spotted through a few simple behaviors. Men who have tiny penes normally over compensate by attempting to own expensive things.For example, a man driving a Ferrari probably has a really small pen. By driving a fancy car, a man is pretty much saying, HEY! Focus on the car, NOT my small pen! PLEASE! If a man feels the need to wave his money in your face, then he is more than likely the owner of an undersized package.A man with a normal pen knows that once the time comes for you to see his pen, it will not be a disappointment, and he will not need other tactics such as bribery to keep you around.&nbsp;&nbsp;

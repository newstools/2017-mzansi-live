1. Small things count. Some guys think all they have to do is surprise us once and they re set for life, but trust us, we&#8217;re keeping note. Why not pick-up our favorite feel-good treat while you re on your way home this evening (clue, it&#8217;s either wine, chocolate or cheese) or buy us that new book we&#8217;ve been talking about non-stop. Trust us, our appreciation will show. 2. The E-word. Effort (a word no man is unfamiliar with) is always the hitch. Take out the trash, call us to see how our day was or do something really special for our anniversary. We&#8217;re worth your time.3. Confidence is hot, arrogance is NOT. Every girl loves a man who s comfortable in his own skin. It makes us feel safe and protected and nothing feels sexier than that. But arrogance? We. Can t. Stand. It. 4. Chivalry is not dead. Be old fashioned from time to time &#8211; we freaking love it. Pay on the first date, hold the door for us and walk us to the front door. Promise, we won t call you stage-five clinger.&nbsp;

Its Official: Itumeleng Khune scores on former Skeem Saam actress Natasha Thahane&nbsp;The Kaizer Chiefs and Bafana Bafana goal minder Itumeleng Khune who is also equally popular off the pitch by dating models and popular personalities has done it again.&nbsp;Khune who dated television personality Minnie Dlamini and fitness trainer Sbahle Mpisane and allegedly had his proposal turned down by Muvhango actress Phindile Gwala is believed to have scored on former Skeem Saam actress Natasha Thahane who bags an acting role on The Queen.&nbsp;According to Khune s friend who requested anonymity, the two have been exchanging conversations, had private dinners and tried by all means to get their relationship off the public domain. Itu has been hurt before, it is public knowledge that losing Minnie (Minnie Dlamini) left him devastated and his heart shuttered, I cannot say he never loved Bahle ( Sbahle Mpisane) , but it was more of pain killing and lust than genuine love itself. Now that Natie (Natasha Thahane) is in the picture I wish the best for my friend, Itu is a gentleman, he deserves to be happy and settle down, he said.&nbsp;Khune could neither accept nor deny the allegations, when called by MzansiLIVE for comment he just said Everything will be good in God s time, God gave me someone who deserves my heart, one who appreciates even the smallest thing I do, when the time is right you will know it.

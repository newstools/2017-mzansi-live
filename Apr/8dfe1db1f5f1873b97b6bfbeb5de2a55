Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema may have more files on Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe s visit to Moria in Polokwane on Sunday.Taking to Twitter on Sunday morning, the minister informed the nation that he had been invited to attend the Zion Christian Church conference at Moria, and it was an honour and privilege to be part of the holy gathering. The ZCC is one of the religious movements that I hold in high repute. I regard the ZCC as the epitome of positive human values, unity and faithfulness, he said.However, the minister has not informed us how his trip was and his silence has caught Malema s attention. Malema tweeted the minister and asked him to take the nation into confidence about what happened in Moria .Responding to Malema, UDM leader Bantu Holomisa asked if the minister was booed when he was introduced at the gathering.I hope @radebe_jeff will take the nation into confidence about what happened at Moria today&#8230;&mdash; Julius Sello Malema (@Julius_S_Malema) April 16, 2017Neither man has yet responded to Holomisa s question.However, some who claim to know what happened said the minister was not allowed in to the holy city by the church, though this idea seems far-fetched as the church itself invited him.Also in attendance at Moria was Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, whose visit was announced by the Presidency. Ramaphosa is the patron of the Moral Regeneration Movement aimed at instilling high moral values in South African society with particular reference to the youth and as part of contributing to social cohesion and the building of a peaceful, non-racial, non-sexist democratic society, said his spokesperson Ronnie Mamoepa on Sunday. In this regard, the Christian church and indeed the entire religious formations of our country have and continue to play a major role in efforts aimed at the reconstruction and development of the soul of our South African society and thus assist in laying a firm foundation for a caring society and the creation of a better life for all South Africans, he added.

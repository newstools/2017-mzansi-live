Maid burns madam s baby because she protests against Zuma&nbsp;A maid (name withheld) is on the run after allegedly burning her employer s baby feet in retaliation to #Zuma must fall protests that took place on Friday.According to sources closer to the family, the maid lived with the family for almost a year and they once had a heated argument last year during municipal elections because the maid dumped her work uniform and started wearing ANC regalia while her bosses are staunch DA supporters.Though the madam refused to talk to the media and referred all the questions to the police, it is believed that the Newcastle born maid burnt her madam s 9 months old baby while her boss was participating in the #ZumaMustFall march on Friday. When we come back from the march, it as late and the baby was crying helplessly, we were first greeted by a note reading: Find your white children in the bed. I burned it because you protest us and you have our land. Zuma will give land us. That s when she rushed to her bedroom in tears, she come back where I was holding her baby with huge blisters on her feet. We rushed the baby to the hospital while some opened a case with the police.

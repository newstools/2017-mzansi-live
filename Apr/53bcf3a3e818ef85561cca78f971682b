This led to Fikile Mbalula issuing an instruction to his lawyers to go ahead and sue Robert Marawa.The lawsuit entails remarks that Marawa had made about Mbalula publicly including on social media networking site Twitter, Sunday World reports. The two have gone back and forth on Twitter, at times blatanly insulting each other. We are not suing him for money but to clear the good name of our client. Whether we are demanding R1 or R10 million is immaterial. Ultimately the court will decide on the amount ameliorate to the damages. The principle here is that allegations like that our client wanted the SABC to fire Mr Marawa were made and we would like that to be retracted because our client never said that, said Mikateko Shirelele, Mbalula s lawyer.Marawa has denied receiving lawyer s letter from Mbalula and refused to comment, citing legal concerns.

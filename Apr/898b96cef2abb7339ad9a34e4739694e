Prophet Paseka Motsoeneng, also known as Prophet Mboro, made the revelation during an interview on Mpumalanga FM.In a recording of the interview, Mboro explains that anointed pregnancy tests by him will help his female members and followers know the man who made them pregnant because it&#8217;s a fact that they are sleeping around without protection and with spiritual husband&#8217;s as well. Explained the prophet: Instead of prophesying about man who made them pregnant they can just use my accurate anointed pregnancy test. I speak the Word to those pregnancy test. The power of God will get in, they use my tests and God does something. He also warned about the terrors of invisible men known as spiritual husbands that stalk ordinary people s houses, sleeping with both men and women.These spiritual husbands who rape cause horror and agony in people s lives, including causing supernatural pregnancies.

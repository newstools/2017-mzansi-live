As we go through life, we learn and grow and so do our friends. It is important as we continue to evolve into the best version of who we can be that we surrounds ourselves with friends who support us.We don t need support in the space where we once were, but rather where we are now and where we are going.Because of the changes we make, it might be time to evaluate our friendships and determine which ones are still serving us.It is exhausting to live in the world of a constant complainer. Something is always wrong, out of place or not up to impossibly high standards. When we spend too much time with a complainer, it becomes easy to start complaining too.In fact, a recent study of college roommates found that over the course of the school year, students starting the year in a positive frame of mind developed more negative thought patterns when living with a negative roommate.The problem with keeping chronic complainers in your life is there isn t anything you can do to help them see the problem. They tend to not view themselves as complainers, and they are resistant to positive reinforcement or advice. The chronic complainer is happiest when the glass is empty.&nbsp;

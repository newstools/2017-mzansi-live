BIDVEST Wits midfielder Elias Pelembe has gone AWOL, which has left his coach Gavin Hunt furious.Pelembe was supposed to report for duty at the club after the international break but has failed to do so.Hunt revealed that the 33-year-old Mozambican born player s failure to report back had forced him to make significant changes to the squad that played against Platinum Stars on Saturday.Wits beat Stars 2-0 in their Absa Premiership clash at Bidvest Stadium to go top of the standings with 41 points from 20 matches. Second placed Kaizer Chiefs have 39 points from 22 games.Phakamani Mahlambi and Daine Klate scored the two goals.Hunt said the disappearance of Pelembe was not something new, as he had done it before when they were both at SuperSport United. Pelembe never turned up, Hunt said. He was in the team for the Platinum Stars game but didn t pitch. He has always been like that, he never turns up. It also happened when we were at SuperSport United. What can we say? He knows why he didn t pitch but we don t. No decision has been taken yet on what will happen to him but we will certainly sort it out. Hunt will do his planning for their next Nedbank Cup clash without considering Pelembe.The Clever Boys face a stiff challenge when they play National First Division side Jomo Cosmos in the Ke Yona Cup Last 16 at Tsakane Stadium tomorrow (7:30pm).Hunt said: We all know it won t to be easy for us. The pitch will be the leveller on match day. I haven t been there for a long time but I am sure it can t be good. It is always a fight against Cosmos. Although we haven t played them for a long time, I don t see that anything has changed. We have to pick a team, go there and play. I am not looking forward to it we will be playing every three days now for the next nine weeks.

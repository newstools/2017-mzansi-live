The star was baptised and confirmed as a member of the Catholic faith this past weekend in a religious ceremony attended by close friends and family members.Speaking to MzansiLIVE, Bernard&#8217;s wife Wendy said that the star had undergone lessons for a year in preparation for the big day and was &#8220;nervous but excited&#8221;.&#8220;He worked hard to try and remember everything he needed to. He attended classes on a weekly basis and do everything that was required of him. He really showed that he wanted this. I am happy because this will bring more stability into his life,&#8221; Wendy said.Bernard had always attended church with the family but his work commitments meant that he was never able to attend the classes needed to qualify him to be baptised into the faith.

We had to get remarried, this time by a Catholic priest in the church, to make it official. Now we are recognised and I couldn&#8217;t be more happy,&#8221; Wendy added.&nbsp;

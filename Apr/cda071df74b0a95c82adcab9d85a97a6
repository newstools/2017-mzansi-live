Johannesburg &#8211; A merchandiser got a little more than yoghurt when he reached into a fridge and found a chilled snake at the Komatipoort Spar in Mpumalanga on Friday.The snake, said to be python, was close to four metres in length, Spar manager Martie Esnouf told MzansiLIVE.&#8220;It got stuck in the fridge. It could have come through the roof or the drains, we have a lot of bush behind the shops, and there are snakes there.&#8221;She said the snake was freed from the fridge and was now under observation and would be released into the nearby Kruger National Park.&#8220;When a snake ends up in the fridge, its organs start shutting down and it could take up to 48 hours for it to be back to normal,&#8221; she said.Instead of driving customers away, the snake seems to have attracted the curious, who want to make sure that the &#8220;poor&#8221; snake had not been harmed.&#8220;The last thing we would do is hurt the poor python,&#8221; she said, calling on people not to panic.The snake invoked mixed reactions on social media on Saturday, with some wondering if it belonged to one of the managers, or was a publicity stunt.

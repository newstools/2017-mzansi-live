Do NOT miss these red flags!It happens all too often. When we get into relationships, sometimes our love can blind us to the many flaws and imperfections of our partners. Sometimes, this can be a good thing. Other times, it can spell doom for a relationship. Self-awareness is an important aspect of self-improvement. We never know how we can grow and develop as people when we don t know what parts of ourselves need improvement. That s why it is important for us to always be vigilant of any suspicious aspects of our relationships.While unconditional love is a good characteristic of any relationship, blind love is not. There is a difference between the two. When you love someone unconditionally, you choose to love that person and help push that person to become more of who they are meant to be. When you love someone blindly, you are choosing to love someone without regard for who they truly are underneath it all. Even if you love someone, you should never be afraid to call out his flaws. Pure honesty and open communication are very important in relationships.That s why you can t afford to just always be falling head over heels for your partner at all times. Try to see your partner and your relationship from an objective perspective. Reflect on whether or not this relationship is actually healthy and is making the both of you better people than you were when you were single.Here are some red flags that you need to be looking out for in your relationship.This is a definite red flag. A man shouldn t be talking about his ex unless you actually ask him about it.If he is constantly bringing up the topic of his ex, then that means that he most probably isn t over her.She still constantly passes through his mind even though he s already in a relationship with you.

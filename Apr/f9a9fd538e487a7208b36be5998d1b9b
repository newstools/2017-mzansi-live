#1 Insecure personalitiesOne of the biggest turn offs for women is a guy who s insecure about himself. If you re not confident about yourself or are feeling nervous, trust me, it shows. This is one of the biggest reasons why guys get spurned on a date.Are you happy being who you are? Do you think you make for great company? If you aren t happy being who you are, what are the odds that the girl you re with would like your company? Some guys have a great positive aura around themselves and some guys are just plain nervous and scared. If you re an insecure guy, it s time to change your behavior. Or lose the girl!&nbsp;

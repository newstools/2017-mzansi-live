Speaking to MzansiLIVE, the designer of the tombstone Lebohang Khitsane confirmed that it was taken back and re-erected on Joe&#8217;s grave on Monday.&#8220;Yes the tombstone was put back yesterday and the Mafela family are happy to have it re-erected,&#8221; he said.The flashy marble tombstone which is a replica of a living room complete with a plasma TV, a TV stand and a couch caused a frenzy on social media last week.The stone which was unveiled after Joe&#8217;s funeral service last Wednesday had to be temporarily removed to allow the &#8220;concrete to settle&#8221;.Pictures of Joe&#8217;s grave without the stone went viral causing widespread speculation that thieves had gotten to it.However, Lebohang explained at the time, that they had agreed with the Mafela family to unveil it at the burial, but remove it straight after. &#8220;It&#8217;s a heavy stone &#8211; 6 tons. The worst thing that could happen is that the stone sinks into the concrete. So we have it removed so it can all settle,&#8221; he explained.About the inspiration behind the one-of-a-kind stone that attracted much attention, Lebohang said that they wanted to reflect how Joe entertained South Africans throughout his life.

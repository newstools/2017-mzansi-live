Cassper has opened a clothing store in Newtown, Johannesburg, where he is selling merchandise.At the launch of the store during the week, he told Zkhiphani.com that the most expensive item in the store was a pair of sneakers he originally bought for R20 000. This pair of shoes is called the Maison Martin Margiela, when I bought it, it was R20 000, and I performed with it at The Dome. So on that night I was wearing it for the very first time. I also wore it for the Zulu girls video, and I haven t worn it since. This is the most expensive item in the shop. If you are a baller, come down and look at this shoe. I don t know if you will buy it to wear it, but it will be a piece that the first time an African act filled up The Dome in that shoe, said Cassper.Cassper is added onto a long list of rappers who have decided to release their own merchandise which includes the likes of K.O, Riky Rick, AKA, Ma-E and more.Nyovest s fans showed their love and support on his new venture in social media.The @Shop_FamilyTree is closing at 3 today&#8230; You have an hour to get there and get your Merchandise!!!

This year&#8217;s nominees were announced in Johannesburg on Thursday evening, but Cassper did not feature on the list.The rapper&#8217;s fans have since inundated social media with a string of questions and speculation over why their icon had not bagged any nods.When called for comment on Friday, Cassper&#8217;s manager, Tlee Mmolawa told MzansiLIVE that Cassper had not submitted his music for &#8220;the same reason&#8221; as last year.Cassper has previously shaded the awards, saying that he would not enter his work for consideration because he &#8220;did not rate&#8221; the SAMAs.&#8220;I don t want to win a SAMA anymore. I m good without them he said on social media last year.The submissions list for this year&#8217;s event, which has been seen by MzansiLIVE confirmed that the Doc Shebeleza rapper did not submit his work for consideration.However, three songs featuring Cassper did appear on list: his collaboration with rapper Kwesta, a collaboration with Major League and a Coke Studio production.Publicist for the SAMAs, Hloni Modise, dismissed &#8220;any beef&#8221; between the organisers and Cassper.&#8220;What is misunderstood as &#8216;beef&#8217; is not with the SAMAs. Rather, the incident that has happened in the past was over some of the rules that the rapper did not agree with. The SAMAs exist to celebrate music,&#8221; she said.

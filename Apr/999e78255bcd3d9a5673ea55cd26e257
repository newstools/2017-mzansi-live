Who said that the church must not interfere in football? As long as it emancipate the community then it s our business and cause of concern. Football will remove kids from streets and away from drugs, football unites people and like the Gospel, it brings hope to people.&nbsp;As End Days Celebration Ministries we have decided to support soccer at grassroots level, both men and women soccer, these kits and a small sum of money represents a new era in our relationship with community at large, this community will benefit from the Body of Christ (the church) even if you are not members of our church, he said to a loud cheer from the crowd.Prophet Mlauzi reveals that he used to enjoy soccer but stopped due to Prophetic reasons. I used to enjoy soccer before I was called to do the work of God, now that I am a Prophet of God every match is now a delayed match because I already know the results before kickoff. Like currently, Bidvest Wits will be crowed PSL Champions at the end of the season and the football fraternity will be shocked by the relegation of Orlando Pirates, he said.He further revealed that the current African Champions Mamelodi Sundowns fate in the Champions League was sealed and they will reach the final but will lose the match in the final minutes due to poor officiating.Prophet Mlauzi s followers reveal that he used to predict all PSL matches correct till he realized that in some way he was promoting gambling in congregants.

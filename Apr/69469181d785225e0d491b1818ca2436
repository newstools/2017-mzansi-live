So you&#8217;ve reached that point in your relationship where you want to take it to the next level. Some people think that s.x is no big deal, but others see it as something they only want to share with an extra-special person.Although you never want to force your girlfriend to have s.x with you, you can always soothe some of her fears and reassure her that you really are a person she can fully trust. After you do this, s.x comes naturally.&nbsp;&nbsp;Show up when you say you&#8217;re going to show up. If you routinely pick her up half an hour late for your dates, she&#8217;ll think that you don&#8217;t think she&#8217;s so special, and she&#8217;ll be less likely to have s.x with you.Don&#8217;t be a flake. If you say you&#8217;re going to take her to the beach over the weekend, do it. If you don&#8217;t stick to your word, she won&#8217;t be able to trust you.Be her rock. Let her talk to you about her problems and insecurities while knowing that you can make her feel better.Don&#8217;t go hours or even a day or two without returning her phone calls or texts. This will make her feel like she can&#8217;t depend on you.&nbsp;

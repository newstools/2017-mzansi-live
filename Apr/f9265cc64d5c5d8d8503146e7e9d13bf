&nbsp;All over the world, footballers are known for earning sky-high salaries and living lavish lifestyles, but later struggle to make ends meet when their careers are over.Golden Arrows striker Njabulo Sithole may be a special case, as he has ensured he&#8217;s set for life after acquiring a Bachelor of Law (LLB) degree.Sithole has been juggling football with education since 2013, and recently graduated at the University of KwaZulu-Natal.&#8220;You should not limit yourself in life,&#8221; he enthused when asked about his recent graduation . &#8220;I encourage other footballers to start planning for the future when they are still in prime of their careers.&#8221;He was part of the Abafana Bes&#8217;thende MultiChoice Diski Challenge (MDC) team that clinched the 2015 reserve league title.The Bergville, KZN-born marksman was promoted to the Arrows first team in 2013. He singles out then Arrows coach Manqoba Mngqithi &#8211; now Sundowns assistant &#8211; as one of the people who helped him to crack top-flight football.&#8220;As a youngster it was scary but also a good feeling to be part of an elite league outfit [Arrows]. Mngqithi played a big role in my development as a player. I will always be grateful to him.&#8221;It is apparent that Sithole has been prioritising his studies over his football career. The striker has only managed to register two appearances with no goal for Arrows&#8217;s first team.Nevertheless, it has not been all smooth sailing. &#8220;I once dislocated my right shoulder during a game. It came at a wrong time because I was busy writing examinations at school. I had to force myself, with pain, and I wrote my tests,&#8221; the 22-year old recalled.Sithole&#8217;s parents also played a pivotal role in his academic accomplishments.&#8220;My mother [Nokuthula] is a domestic worker and my father [Michael] is a clerk. At some point I had to awaken my father to help me read my notes. I am grateful to them because they have always been supportive,&#8221; a chuffed Sithole said.After his recent academic achievements, he has taken a year -long break from the beautiful game to pursue a master&#8217;s degree in maritime law.

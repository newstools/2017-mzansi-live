&#8220;This might answer a few questions.&#8221;Relationships can be very puzzling for a lot of women. Boys are just typically really difficult to figure out. You never know what s going on in their minds for sure. You could be out on a date with a really nice guy and in your perspective, everything is going incredibly well. However, you find yourself waiting for a phone call that s never going to come; a call asking you out for a second date.Why is that the case? You were almost certain that he would ask you out again. You had a chemistry and you knew it was something that could be built upon. You were fairly sure that you would be going out on a second date and yet, you aren t. What s the deal?Don t stress about it too much. Just know that just because in your head, everything was going swell doesn t necessarily mean that that was what he was thinking too. There are plenty of possible reasons as to why a guy wouldn t ask a girl out on a second date, and sometimes the reasons don t even have anything to do with the girl.Even if you think that things were going great, it may not have necessarily been the case from his perspective. Maybe you just aren t the girl he s looking for and you just have to move on from that fact. There s not much you can do at this point.&nbsp;

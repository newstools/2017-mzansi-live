No matter which way you slice it, s.x is tricky. Even outside of worrying about unwanted pregnancies or STIs, getting two people on the same page (or, if you&#8217;re into that, three people) about their desires, their wills, their wont&#8217;s, their cant&#8217;s, and their many shades of maybes can be incredibly tricky.If you&#8217;re all about open s.xual communication, great! Congrats to you. But it&#8217;s fair to say that many people still struggle to talk openly and honestly about what exactly they want in bed &#8212; and women are often the ones who struggle with this the hardest, since they&#8217;re often taught not to be too s.xual or not to express their s.xual desires for fear of seeming promiscuous.It&#8217;s not that asking for what you really want in bed is hard. But most women would agree that the the timing for having that kind of conversation with their guy never seems to feel right.&#8220;Especially when he first puts it in me,&#8221; says Amber, 23. &#8220;There&#8217;s an obvious change in expression when someone enters you.I know that mine changes also, so there&#8217;s the whole me seeing him seeing me, take him into me thing that gets me so turned on.But also staying with me in other ways during s.x, like kissing me while he&#8217;s giving it to me.Or if he&#8217;s on top of me and I have my hands up and he slides his hand into mine and holds it while thrusting into me &#8212; moves that make the experience feel more int_imate, and make us feel more connected to the guy, which makes the s.x feel more passionate.&#8221;&nbsp;

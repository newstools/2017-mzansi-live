Members of the Health and Other Services Personnel Trade Union of South Africa (Hospersa) at national parks on Thursday resumed their strike for higher wages.The strike was suspended last week after a new offer tabled by the employer, the SA National Parks (SANParks). However, the union said the offer was rejected. Horspersa members rejected the new offer as it will not equally benefit every employee. SANParks new offer is a 6.1 percent salary increase and a 1 percent salary progression for qualifying employees, said Hospersa general secretary Noel Desfontaine. The 1 percent pay progression is only for those employees who will be benefiting from the introduction of salary notches as a response to salary disparities. The union had initially demanded a 9 percent salary increase when it first downed tools last week. That demand was later lowered to 7.5 percent. Our members demand is a fair increase that benefits all employees. Unfortunately the offer put forward by SANParks falls short of our members demands, and as a result, the industrial action continues, said Desfontaines.Workers on strike included rangers, field guides, cleaners and security guards.SANParks, which runs 19 national parks including prime tourist resorts Kruger National Park, Table Mountain National Park and the Karoo National Park, this week warned it might have to further postpone bookings for 2018 for at least one week because of the strike.According to sources, Kruger National Park rangers threatened to set dangerous animals free posing a deadly threat to the communities around and livestock.&nbsp;SANParks could not be immediately reached to comment.&nbsp;

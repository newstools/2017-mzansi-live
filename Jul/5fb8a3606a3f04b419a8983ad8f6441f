The Olympic 800m champion was interviewed by Dr Ali Bacher on SuperSport channel yesterday.Semenya spoke openly about the scandal in an interview that was aired on Friday and repeated last night.The revered Limpopo-born runner revealed that when the officials were speaking of chromosomes and questioning if she was a woman or a man, she was confused.Semenya said the whole process of verification felt like being stripped off her clothes and made to walk in public.Semenya said she was confused when they said she had an edge over other female athletes because of the higher testosterone in her body.&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand when you say I have an advantage because I am a woman.&#8220;When I pee, I pee like a woman. I don&#8217;t understand when you say I am a man or I have a deep voice,&#8221; Semenya said.&#8220;I know I like man&#8217;s stuff, that is not a question, the question is where do I fall in? I am a female that is not a question, that is how I have been raised since I was young.&#8221;Semenya said even after she was banned from running for eight months, she never allowed the scandal to get into her.However, she criticised the way the matter was handled because her parents were not informed about the verification process.&#8220;My mother was affected because she was the one who was changing my nappies when I was young.&#8221;Semenya said at that time, there were even reports that she might have changed her gender.&#8220;How the hell can you change gender in the rural areas? I&#8217;m a woman. We don&#8217;t have good doctors, we are not rich to do such procedures.&#8221;She added that she still believes that she was living testimony, and has touched many people&#8217;s lives.Semenya is among athletes who will represent SA at the IAAF World Championships in London next month.

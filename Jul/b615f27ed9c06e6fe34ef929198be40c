Men transporting money had to abandon their truck and hide in the bush when they were ambushed in Pretoria on Friday morning.First to respond, guards from United Body Guards Response Team told MzansiLive that SBV guarding the cash in the truck stopped and jumped out of the truck and fled to safety of the bush when they heard gunfire. A guard who later returned to the scene said the occupants of a white Mercedes Benz Vito behind them opened fire on the truck, said Wesley Roux of United.It was unclear if any of the SBV guards in the truck were hit.It is suspected the robbers then helped themselves to the money in the unattended truck and left.Roux said the heist happened on Cullinan Road at about 8am.Roux said normally SBV sent four guards in the truck. Just one returned to the scene, and we re still trying to track down the other three who ran away, said Roux. Police are investigating and should confirm how much was taken soon. The police could not be reached for comment.

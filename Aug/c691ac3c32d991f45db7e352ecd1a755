The opposition s motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma failed in the National Assembly on Tuesday, but confirmed growing dissent in the ranks of the ANC as at least 26 ruling party MPs defied a three-line whip to vote in favour of it.Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema said it was cause to celebrate and showed that the opposition s battle to secure a secret ballot for the measure was not a waste of time because it had emboldened African National Congress MPs to vote according to conscience. We got 26 votes from the ANC direct and 35 indirect because there were nine abstentions We thank them for their courage. When we said to you we are eating an elephant bit-by-bit, we were not joking, he said, adding that the opposition would persist with its attempts to oust Zuma from office even after Tuesday s eighth failed attempt.Sources within the ANC intelligence ranks reveals a list to president Jacob Zuma and how they got it is yet to be established.These ANC MPs voted with the opposition1.

He has single-handedly propelled the expression into pop culture lexicon with an amateur video clip that went viral and is now a sought-after music talent.Sakhile Hlatshwayo is himself stunned at the wave of excitement that the recording has caused. The Grade 11 learner at Lavela Secondary School in Zola says what surprised him the most is that as a gospel singer, he never thought he would record a house or gqom song. He sings baritone in the Stay PC Church Choir and African Heavenly Soul Singers male choir.Hlatshwayo, who goes by the stage name of Killer Kau, is on the brink of fame with the single Tholukuthi Hey being produced by renowned DJ Euphonik. He says it all started about three weeks ago when he made a silly video of himself while chilling with friends and posted it on WhatsApp. His contacts asked him to send it to them and, in no time, it had gone viral within his circle of friends.His sister suggested they put it on You Tube.&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think it would get any views and everyone asked if it was a track. Euphonik came up with a proposal and now it has become a song,&#8221; he says, noting that the song has thrust him into the spotlight.&#8220;When my teachers heard that I made a song with Euphonik they congratulated me and were happy for me, but they did advise me to focus on my school work.&#8221;Hlatshwayo says his dream is to study law so he could one day be a judge.He says his grandmother and father, whom he lives with, are &#8220;more than happy&#8221; for him and have encouraged him to do whatever he likes.As such, he will be working on releasing his debut album.He describes himself as &#8220;kind, crazy &#8211; not in a bad way&#8221;. He likes dancing and interacting with people.Hlatshwayo looks forward to the Spring Jump Off 17 festival where he will make his first career appearance as Killer Kau.The event, which is organised by Vetkuk vs Mahoota, takes place on September 2 at Mahungra Car Wash in Bloemfontein and will see about 65 DJs take to the decks.Hlatshwayo will occupy his rightful place among heavyweights such as Cassper Nyovest, Oskido, Kwesta, Da L.E.S, Vinny, Major League, Black Motion and Ganyani.&#8220;I&#8217;m more than happy to perform for more than 10000 people. I have been preparing myself to ensure that I make them happy.&#8221;With all the attention, he says he feels like a celebrity. &#8220;People want to take pictures with me, they want to talk to me, it&#8217;s been great.&#8221;After all&#8217;s said and done, he is still a township lad who enjoys the simple things in life, like a bowl of amasi and pap.&nbsp;

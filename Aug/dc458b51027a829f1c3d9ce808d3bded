Another dark day! RIP tsekelekeA post shared by vetkuk (@vetkuk) on Aug 1, 2017 at 12:30pm PDT&nbsp;Tributes have been pouring in for the late star, with Minister of Arts and Culture Nathi Mthethwa saying: We send our sincere condolences to the family and friends of a sensational avant-garde of Kwaito, Tsekeleke, who has sadly passed on. Tsekeleke was diagnosed with diabetes a few years back and was told his right leg would have to be amputated, a suggestion he was against. I would rather die than to have my leg amputated. I have faith and belief that God will answer my prayers. My father was also diabetic and he had a problem with his leg and they amputated it. But he later died of the disease, so I would rather die than have it amputated, he told The Sowetan at the time.He then turned to Incredible Happenings Church leader Paseka Mboro Motsoeneng for divine intervention.Mboro reportedly placed the kwaito star on a two-month rehabilitation programme called Eight Weeks of Incredible Journey with Mboro, which involves special prayer sessions for congregants suffering from leg-related illnesses.

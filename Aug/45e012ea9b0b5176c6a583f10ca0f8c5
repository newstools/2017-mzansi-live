When a farmer was told there were people living on his farm, he thought they might be criminals, South Coast Herald reportsHe was, however, totally wrong; the uninvited guests were just innocent boys.The three youngsters, aged between 13 and 17, had allegedly been told by their pastor to camp on the farm for seven days. They were instructed to pray, drink warm water to induce vomiting and inhale muti vapour with no food intake.Farmer Sya Gasa, 32, said: It pained me to see them with nothing to eat but my sugarcane. The guardian of one of the boys, Thobeka Sibiya (31), confirmed she was aware of the matter and said the pastor was doing nothing wrong but was helping the boys, and was good at healing the sick.Attempts to track down the pastor have been unsuccessful.Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Zandra Wiid said no case had been opened and the matter was in the hands of social workers.

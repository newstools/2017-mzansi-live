Ahead of SAMA23 over the weekend the Wololo hitmaker said that if she did not walk away with any trophies, she would be boycotting awards.Somizi, who was a host of the show, threw some shade Babes&#8217; way and she immediately got trending on the night.Since then there have been over 95,000 tweets about her as she walked away with nada at the awards and then posted a very angry vent video on her Instagram account.&#8220;These awards are sold. Continue buying the awards. But it&#8217;s fine, we won&#8217;t starve,&#8221; she said.Celebs have rallied behind her and urged her not to place so much importance on the trophy.I cav y&#39;all Tsibinkies talking but all I&#39;m saying is there&#39;s no one for Babes Wodumo!!! She&#39;s the furthest!!! I&#39;m talking superstar level!!&mdash; Abuti Fill Up (@CassperNyovest) May 28, 2017The Babes Wodumo story I can relate to so strongly I feel quite sad at the same time happy for her success and team.&mdash; Culoe De Song (@CuloeDeSong) May 28, 2017On another note I hope @BABESWODUMO is not disheartened tonight! She still shines!

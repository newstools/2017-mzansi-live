&nbsp;You may be the reason why you&#8217;re single. Give this a read.Are you stuck in a rut? Are you having trouble finding people who would be willing to be in a relationship with you? Perhaps what you need is a break in the monotony. Maybe you need to shake things up a little in life. Maybe you need to stop doing a few things and start building new habits. A lot of times, there are plenty of little habits that we keep doing that sabotage our chances of getting into relationships. And these habits have a tendency to be performed unnoticed or subconsciously. You have to develop a sense of self-awareness if you want to find success in dating. You have to know how people react to you and how they perceive you as a person.If you continue to go on in life nonchalantly without caring about fixing your attitude or personality, then you will have a very difficult time finding someone who would actually like you. You need to learn to project the best possible version of yourself as a person. You have to exude a character that is mature, stable, kind, and patient. To do that, you will have to rid yourself of a few habits that are holding you back.Move on. There is a reason that your previous relationship ended. There is a reason that you want to move forward in your life. There is no way that you could successfully move on in life and in love if you are still always staying in touch with your ex. No person in their right mind would want to date someone who is still hung over an ex.&nbsp;

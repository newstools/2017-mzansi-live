In 2014 Bonang&#8217;s contract with Metro FM was terminated after she signed a deal with rival pay-TV station SuperSport, a move that had not been approved by the SABC.It was revealed at the time that Bonang&#8217;s parents personally went to then COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng in an attempt to keep her job.The broadcaster issued a statement explaining that Bonang had apologised and withdrew all of her public statements on the issue.However, sources close to the diva reveal that Hlaudi attempted to sleep with Bonang in exchange of protection and favors to which the diva refused.&#8220;Bonang refused to take Hlaudi&#8217;s offer after Euphonik confronted her and bared Hlaudi&#8217;s move. If it wasn&#8217;t for Euphonik, Hlaudi could have had a piece of Bonang&#8217;s cake,&#8221; she said.Bonang could neither confirm nor deny the allegations.

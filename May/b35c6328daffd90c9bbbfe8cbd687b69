Us mere mortals normally rush in and out of the shower. But not Somizi.If there&#8217;s one person who can inspire us to take more time to relax, even if it&#8217;s in the bath, it has to be Somgaga.&#8220;Always try to sleep on a great note that will celebrate your victory of the day,&#8221; he wrote.Right, we&#8217;re going to try this. Always try to sleep on a great note to celebrate yo victory of a day that will forever be a memory. No matter how bad sometimes things may be. Attract joy.

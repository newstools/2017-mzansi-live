IT SEEMS allegations of theft just keep following new kid on the block, Babes Wodumo.The self-proclaimed queen of gqom was first accused of stealing her hit song, Wololo.And now, she s accused of stealing from two kwaito musicians from Umlazi, in KwaZulu-Natal.The musicians Smanga Mhlongo and Siphiwe Manzi allege that Babes stole their song and titled it Ngangingekho Ebusheni Bakho.They claim Babes only changed the beat but everything else, including the lyrics, is the same.They alleged that when they confronted Babes about it on Facebook, she accused them of wanting to drag her name through the mud because of her success. She even accused us of being jealous of her success, and then blocked us, said Smanga.He said they produced the song in 2015 and titled it #24. We were shocked to hear it on radio, sung by Babes. The two musicians said DJ Sox, whose real name is Mbusi Sokhela, might be involved in this. We suspect DJ Sox has something to do with this. We sent him the song to listen to in 2015, as we wanted his opinion on it. He promised to get back to us but never did. We find it strange that he s the one who produced Babes s song, Smanga added.Siphiwe said: We ll meet in court with Babes and DJ Sox if necessary. Babes denied stealing the song, saying she recorded the it in 2013: I m tired of being accused of theft. She also denied insulting the boys on Facebook. She said they never communicated with her.MzansiLIVE has been trying to get comment from DJ Sox since Thursday. He was still not available at the time of going to print yesterday.

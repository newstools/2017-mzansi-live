Bidvest Wits have been crowned Absa Premiership champions for the first time in their history, after recording a 2-0 win over Polokwane City.Wits signalled their intent early on and broke the deadlock in the fourth minute when James Keene headed home at the near post.The home side controlled possession for most of the opening exchanges as Polokwane struggled to make the presence felt in the midfield.Rise and Shine, on the other hand, failed to threaten Wits defence in the final third and it was a relatively quiet evening for half Darren Keet.Keet&#8217;s opposite number, George Chigova had to be at his best just before the halftime break as the Zimbabwean produced a superb save to deny Mhango from close range.The score remained 1-0 to the home side at the halftime break.The hosts picked up from where they left off in the opening stanza, while Polokwane continued to sit back and soak up the pressure.Wits eventually doubled their lead on the hour mark, as Daine Klate exchanged passes with Mogakolodi Ngele, before drilling the ball into the far corner.Pelembe and Keene continued to threaten for the home side as they pushed for more goals in the second half.Gavin Hunt opted for a change after 77 minutes as Phumlani Ntshangas replaced Ngele, while Polokwane introduced Walter Maponyane for Tshepo Tema.Wits managed to see out the closing stages with relative ease, and with Mamelodi Sundowns losing to Maritzburg, Wits have been crowned Champions with one game to play.&nbsp;

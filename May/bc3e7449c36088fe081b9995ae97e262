The former MP reveals she rejected the instruction from the man with an Indian accent to meet Zuma out of hand.In a latest revelation, former MP and fierce Zuma critic Vytjie Mentor tells of how the president sent a certain man with an Indian accent to my hotel in China to go and fetch me and take me to him. It was an early evening, first day of the official state visit. I was about to leave to go and attend the state banquet. I was shocked, it was early evening. Mentor wrote in a Facebook post: The man said Zuma wanted me to join him at the Chinese Presidential Guest House, where he was putting (sic) courtesy of the Chinese Goverment. I refused as Zuma is a womanizer of note. The former MP went on: The man with an Indian accent threatened me. He dropped the phone saying he is going to report me to Zuma that I was refusing to go with to go and see him. I told him I did not care, he could phone him. He said he would call again after 10 15 minutes. And he did call again after a few minutes. He said the President was insisting that I go and see him at the Presidential Guest House. I told him I insist too that I was not going there. I dropped the phone, unhooked it, and used my cell phone to arrange for the next flight home the next day. Mentor said she ended up not going to the state banquet. When she returned home, she was called by a Sunday Times journalist about the trip to China. She further said she discovered with time that the journalist was in the Zuma-Gupta camp. She claimed she was falsely accused of having abused her powers to go to China.The speaker, who was at the time Max Sisulu, was asked to probe the trip. Mentor reiterated that Sisulu did, and found no wrongdoing on her part. They removed me from the Chair position [she was chairperson of the public enterprises portfolio committee] and then had me reported to the PP. She [the public protector] did not make any adverse conclusion against me, Mentor says.

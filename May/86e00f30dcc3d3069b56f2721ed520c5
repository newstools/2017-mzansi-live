Is your partner holding you back?When we choose to get into a relationship, it is absolutely necessary for us to make a few compromises every now and then. Because of our individuality, it would be virtually impossible for us to always be in sync with our partners. That is why compromises are necessary.When we have disagreements with our partners, we have to be able to find a middle ground in order to preserve the balance and the harmony in the relationship. Couples must always be willing to give up little bits of themselves for the sake of the romance.However, a lot of people can make the mistake of compromising too much of who they are. You should never be willing to give up the important parts of yourself for the sake of the relationship. If you essentially give up your sense of identity, then that is never a good thing for the union.No relationship is ever worth giving up your personality and your ideals for. You should be willing to make some compromises, yes. But your partner should also accept that there are facets to your personality that are non-negotiable.This includes your goals and dreams. You have your personal aspirations. You have envisioned a future for yourself and you can t just give them up.In the end, you will end up resenting your partner for standing in the way of the future that you wanted. So it s better to see the signs early on.You have to know if you have a partner who is going to support you with your goals, or if you have one who is going to keep you from achieving them. This way, you can make a few adjustments to your life as you see fit.You don t want to have a partner who encourages you to just put things off as often as possible.You should look for a partner who actually encourages you to work on your responsibilities.You don t want someone who discourages you from getting your work done early.&nbsp;

Especially when you&#8217;re tired. Or hungover. Or just extra lazy.Talk about a warm and fuzzy feeling. Watching your partner go out of their way to be nice to your peeps is the best.Some days, it&#8217;s the one thing you need. The only thing.That food. That special food that makes everything better.Or a back massage. It depends where you need it.IT FEELS LIKE A GIFT FROM THE DAMN GODS.When you&#8217;re already snuggled into the couch it feels like it would be a monumental task.It&#8217;s the true way to a woman&#8217;s heart. Pizza also wouldn&#8217;t go amiss.Even if you&#8217;re really down, they can somehow get you barreled over with laughter. And it&#8217;s a great feeling.

A fistfight between two men caused a commotion in front of Westend SUPERSPAR in Mpumalanga, and bystanders had to intervene to separate them, Lowvelder reports.A video of the incident surfaced on social media shortly afterwards, but it was not clear what caused the altercation. All you see from the video is a man attacking another, who ends up on the ground.The ruckus drew a crowd. Some bystanders attempted to pull the attacker off the man on the ground before a SUPERSPAR employee escorted him away from the scene.A man who helped to break up the fight was later identified as Riaan Stander. He told Lowvelder it was very unexpected. I was heading towards the entrance of the store when I saw the two men glaring at each other. The next moment they grabbed each other and started fighting. I don t know these men from a bar of soap, and I don t know why they were fighting, but I jumped in to help break it up because the one guy sustained a nasty head injury, Stander said.Lowvelder reported earlier that security guards on the scene reported that the men were fighting over a woman.Stander said: I have no idea if a woman played any role in the fight, but one of the two men had who I presumed was his girlfriend there, and she was yelling at them to stop fighting. Westend SUPERSPAR manager Andr Willcocks said: Two customers came to blows at the entrance of the store regarding a personal matter. The two managers on duty, with the help of a few customers, managed to separate them. The one customer then left the scene with the help of centre security. The managers on duty then offered to assist the second customer, who had in the process gashed his head. He said he would be okay and then left the store. According to local police spokesperson Captain Dawie Pretorius, no case regarding the incident had been opened with the police.

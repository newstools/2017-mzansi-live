Johannesburg &#8211; The ANC has condemned the &#8220;unfortunate and reckless&#8221; decision taken by the Eskom board to reinstate Brian Molefe as CEO.&#8220;Mr Molefe left Eskom under a cloud following the release of the Public Protector&#8217;s report into State Capture late last year. The report, while still under review, made observations against Mr. Molefe which, at the time, he had deemed serious and significant enough to warrant his resignation. Amongst others, he cited the interests of the company, good corporate governance and the interest of the public, as underlying his departure from the utility.

Johannesburg Dead-faced and stoically looking forward, Sandile Mantsoe made his first appearance for the murder of Karabo Mokoena at the Johannesburg Magistrates Court on Friday; facing the possibility of a life sentence.He is charged for premeditated murder and a second charge of defeating the ends of justice has also been added to the charges Mantsoe faces.This possibly relates to him allegedly burning the mortal remains of Karabo after allegedly killing her.MzansiLIVE The Star reported on Friday that Karabo&#8217;s paternal uncle, Tshepo Mokoena, said that his niece might have opened a case of common assault against her boyfriend, but this could not be confirmed by Sandton police.Speaking to reporters outside the court room, NPA spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane said:&#8221;This forms part of the merits of the case and, as the NPA, we are not prepared to divulge information that will jeapordise our case.&#8221;Full details of the murder will emerge during the trial, Mjonondwana added.Tshepo Mokoena told reporters outside the court room that he saw surveillance footage of the suspect&#8217;s family members entering Mantsoe&#8217;s Sandton apartment, and leaving with towels and linens. This has fuelled speculation that the suspect&#8217;s family helped him clean up the scene of the crime; further defeating the ends of justice.Tshepo had told MzansiLIVE this week that he and some of his family had seen surveillance footage of Mantsoe allegedly disposing of his niece&#8217;s body.RELATED: Everything we know about Karabo murder suspect Sandile Mantsoe&#8220;We saw (surveillance) footage of him getting those big, black dustbins with wheels that are used by Pikitup, where he took the bin into the apartment, and a few hours later, he took the bin out, he explained.RELATED: She Cheated, It Was Terrible Karabo Mokoena s Boyfriend Shares Reason He Killed Her&nbsp;

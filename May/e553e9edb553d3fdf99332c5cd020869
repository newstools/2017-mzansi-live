An MTN user wrote a complaint tweet to the MTN customer Twitter account at the weekend, stating that the service provider had startlingly taken her data and airtime from her phone, and no one from the service provider had allegedly replied to the email she had sent earlier regarding the matter.In response to the customer s inquiry, MTN allegedly made a comment saying what had happened to her was sad however, at least she still had land. That s sad, but at least you have the land, the account supposedly belonging to MTN tweeted.Though the tweet was allegedly removed from the account, a screenshot was taken of it and it circulated on social media. It sparked some debate on the issue of land redistribution, as well as why a corporate company with a mix of clients would want to get itself caught up in such a controversial issue. pic.twitter.com/QLSnPcWchF&mdash; Bulelani Phillip (@BulelaniPhillip) May 22, 2017The EFF has led the debate on the land issue, emphasizing their view that it has taken too much time for black people to have land that was previously taken from them.The land issue has been discussed in parliament, often very heatedly.We contacted the service provider and MTN sent an email on Tuesday morning acknowledging that they had received the email and would get back to us with a detailed response.We are still awaiting their response. The service provider is not denying that the tweet was indeed sent from their account, though the screenshot may well turn out to be photoshopped.&nbsp;&nbsp;

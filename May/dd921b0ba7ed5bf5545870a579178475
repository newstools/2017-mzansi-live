M any people know what it takes to maintain balanced, happy relationships in life: love, trust, compassion, compromise, laughter, a deep connection, and respect, to name a few. However, a lot of us don t even recognize if we re in love with the wrong person To cultivate supportive, healthy relationships in life, you have to find out what you don t want, and sometimes that involves being in the wrong relationship. Here s how to tell:In the beginning of a relationship, you naturally want to spend as much time with the person as you can since everything about it feels fresh and new, and you absolutely love the person you re with. Of course, you still feel the same about your guy or girl after a few months, but you might crave some time away from them occasionally to continue your own personal growth.While your partner should be a huge part of your life, it s important to make sure they re not the only part of your life. Research shows that once a relationship becomes stagnant, people start to forget why they re in the relationship to begin with, and look for a way out so they can feel that initial spark again with someone new. To avoid having this happen, hanging out with friends or spending time alone is important in keeping the spark alive in the relationship and being able to grow evenly during time spent apart.If this time apart doesn t feel comfortable, there is an underlying trust issue, and since trust is a cornerstone of any relationship, you may want to reassess your relationship.&nbsp;

THEMBISILE Ntaka is 52 years old and a proud virgin. Even at my age, I still go to Umkhosi woMhlanga, said Thembisile at a social cohesion dialogue about virginity. It was organised by eThekwini Municipality at Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban on Tuesday night. I began this journey when I was 14 years old. I get a lot of people criticising me for being a virgin and not having children. Some even tell me I will die a lonely woman. But that does not make me want to change my life. Thembisile said she has never slept with a man or even kissed one. She said she is one of the most respected women in Botha s Hill.Thembisile encouraged young women to stay virgins. I m the lastborn at home. My eight siblings got married and left me with my brother s two children. She said when she was young she heard her brothers friends saying bad things about the girls they d had sex with. I decided then I didn t want to be one of those girls, she said. She said each time there is virginity testing in her area, she is always the first one in line. I don t care if I die without children or a husband. I m happy with my life and so is my family. During the conference, where virgins and virginity testers discussed the importance of purity, tester Zanele Shezi-Sishi said it s important for women to look after themselves. Staying a virgin helps to avoid infections and disease. Head of recreation at eThekwini Municipality, Thembinkosi Ngcobo, said they chose the topic because too many girls fall pregnant at an early age.

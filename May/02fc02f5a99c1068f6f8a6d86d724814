The pair had fans clapping when they embraced in a nightclub at the end of Cassper&#8217;s Fill Up Orlando Stadium gig last year. For many, it signalled an end to a feud that had included everything from physical threats to diss tracks and Twitter insults.Speaking to Metro FM&#8217;s DJ Fresh at the launch of his third studio album, Cassper said that the hug was a PR excercise that he just rolled with.&#8220;I say on the album n****rs ask for forgiveness in public just for the PR. It was a well calculated move. In the morning I saw the tweets and I already knew what was going on. He wanted to come take a picture so everyone could see. I acted stupid but I knew what was going on so I smiled.&#8220;I let people play whatever they want to play. If you want to be fake, then do it. If it was genuine that we were cool, then we would have still been cool now because I still haven&#8217;t done anything wrong. But if you have a bitter heart it will come out, you will tweet these things,&#8221; Cassper said.The Doc Shebeleza rapper did not hold back and told Fresh that he would &#8220;never&#8221; work with AKA.&#8220;Never! Music, for me, is like making a kid together. We have to nurture this child together because we have a bond forever. So if I don&#8217;t trust you and people are always switching sides, I&#8217;ll never work with you. Especially not for money. I&#8217;d never compromise myself for money,&#8221; Cassper added.AKA had fans in a huff when he released a new song on the same day as Cassper dropped his highly-anticipated album. He later took to Twitter to claim that he had not done it to steal Cassper&#8217;s shine.Good morning &#8230;. guys, I legit didn&#39;t know niggas was dropping today &#8230;. sorry &#8230;. not sorry.&mdash; AKA (@akaworldwide) May 5, 2017

Women in Durban have apparently started thinking twice before spending thousands of rands on Brazilian and Peruvian wigs, as that is exactly what Nyaope addicts have started targeting to sell for drugs.The weaves that cost from R3 000, depending on the length, have now become a quick-buck scheme for the addicts in the Durban CBD, who then sell them to hair salons or other people on the street for a cheaper price.Nqo Khumalo, of Diamond Hair Salon, told Daily Sun she has had many addicts come to her salon to sell the wigs for as little as R250, which is a bargain for a wig that costs about R3 000.Khumalo reportedly said her clients did buy the wigs even though they know they had been taken off another woman s head. Though she was worried about the trend, she told the tabloid she could not stop it, as she was afraid of confronting the perpetrators.The perpetrators have apparently mastered the art of differentiating between a wig and a weave.Durban Central Police Station s Captain Khephu Ndlovu confirmed to the tabloid that he had received several complaints from women who were robbed of their pricey wigs.He further advised women to avoid areas around King Dinuzulu Park, Warwick Junction, Field Street and The Worshop Shopping Centre if they wanted to keep their wigs.

I was admitted, and after the doctor did a scan, she told me I had miscarried. I sat on the hospital bed numb. I called my mom and my ex, who both cried, she told True Love.Lerato also said she had been going for counselling, which helped her find peace and closure with a lot of things that she was dealing with in her life.

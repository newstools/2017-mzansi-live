City have been a revelation this season and several of their star players have drawn admiring glances from their well-heeled rivals.But City coach Eric Tinkler is having none of it and he said they are planning to bid for the likes of Tshabalala and Tau if they become available on the market.Mosimane told journalists in March that he was eyeing Manyama and his interest in the City captain seemingly rubbed Tinkler up the wrong way.A peeved Tinkler said Mosimane must follow protocols if he is interested in his players. If other people want our players we&#8217;re prepared to match them and that&#8217;s what my owners say &#8221; Tinkler said.&#8220;Pitso talks too much. He needs to go through the proper channels instead of through the media and through the players. There have to be plans to beef up the squad for next season because we&#8217;re not here just to make up the numbers.&#8220;We&#8217;ve proved that this year and we&#8217;ve got a very ambitious club owner in John Comitis who doesn&#8217;t want to lose his players.&#8220;Aubrey Ngoma is not for sale Lebogang Manyama is not for sale.&#8220;Ajax was all about development and moving players on.&#8220;We&#8217;re not about that business. We want to win trophies. Wednesday evening&#8217;s 4-2 defeat at the hands of SuperSport United killed off whatever chances Cape Town City had of winning the league.They came into the game in third place on 52 points and badly needed a win to reel in log leaders Bidvest Wits and Mamelodi Sundowns.While both sides have tricky assignments away to Free State Stars and Baroka FC at home respectively Tinkler has resigned himself to the realisation that their league campaign is dead in the water.

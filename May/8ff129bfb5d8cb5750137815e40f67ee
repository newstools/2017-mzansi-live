According to tabloid paper Sunday World, Kaizer Chiefs assistant coach John Paintsil allegedly took his fight with his landlord and the managers of the townhouse complex to another level .They report that the 36-year-old former Ghana defender pulled a crazy stunt at his 214-unit complex that caused numerous residents to be late for work and school on Thursday.Although Paintsil denied all the allegations against him, saying he did not even stay at the place in question, the security company at the complex confirmed to the paper that Paintsil had blocked the exit because the electricity to his unit had allegedly been cut off at the behest of the owner .The security operations manager was quoted as saying that the coach had illegally reconnected electricity and changed locks to the box. He instructed me to cut off his new locks and switch off his electricity and replace the locks. The former English Premiership star is allegedly three months behind on his rent.In his anger at the situation, Paintsil reportedly parked his car in front of the complex gate on Thursday morning and it took police to remove him after almost three hours.Leslie van Zyl of the security company told the paper: They threatened to lock him up and tow his car if he did not remove it. An unnamed witness told the paper that Paintsil had acted like a man possessed and had allegedly threatened witchcraft on people trying to reason with him.

High school seniors Phillip and Anna, attended their school prom last week.Although the two good friends had a fantastic time, Anna s father didn t approve of her attending with a black student, and subsequently went on a racist tirade after seeing social media photos of the event. We are done. I wont be coming to your graduation. Nor will I pay for your college. Go live with the n***ers, he begins in a text message. I went to prom with a black guy so that s a problem? Racist much, Anna responded. Yes I am, he admitted. Your dead to me. The verbal abuse gets worse and he even refers to Anna s black friend as subhuman.

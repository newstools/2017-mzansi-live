Many people have fallen victim to the harsh realities that love can bring into their lives.It s understandable for us to always want to chase after love. We try our best to find love in our lives because we know that love is what really makes the world go round.Love is what motivates us to wake up every morning to live life. However, love can also betray us.We become too desperate to experience love in our lives, our minds may end up distorting reality a little bit to fit our expectations.Our minds can trick us into believing that we are in a loving relationship even when we really aren t. As powerful as the emotion of love can be, we must always try to maintain a sense of objectivism in our relationships.We can t afford to dupe ourselves into believing lies that we set for ourselves.You start to put meaning into things that aren t really there.

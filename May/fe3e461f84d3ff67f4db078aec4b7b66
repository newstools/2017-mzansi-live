Senior Shembe pastor Mthandeni Ntombela on Tuesday told Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa that he was not the first leader to have approached the church asking for prayers.Even President Jacob Zuma apparently approached the church and asked to be made president and for his criminal cases to go away , he was reportedly told. Though the prayer for him to become president was answered, the president has been experiencing misfortunes during his reign, which has been mired in endless court cases.The problem with Zuma, according to Ntombela, is that he has forgotten to go back to the church and thank the Lord, hence his woes .Ramaphosa visited Empangeni, in KwaZulu-Natal, at the invitation of Prophet Mduduzi Shembe and received a warm welcome, though some were not pleased with his visit.The deputy president reportedly told the church he was there to learn about Inkosi uShembe and to ask the church to pray for the ANC and government. However, soon after addressing reporters, he was reportedly confronted by senior pastors, who told him to be straightforward and tell the church he was there to ask for to be president of the ANC, The Sowetan has reported.The church leader advised Ramaphosa against making the same mistake as IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who reportedly approached the church and made the mistake of asking for peace instead of saying he wanted to win. Hence he never governed.Ramaphosa was told to go back to the church on July 4.

A little bit of crazy is just what we need!One of the most challenging aspects of the dating life is finding that one perfect person with whom you would be willing to take a risk. Because let s face it, love and romance is always going to be a risk. No one is ever guaranteed any success in love and relationships. And yet, every day people are falling in love. They invest themselves into their relationships hoping that it will all turn out great in the end. However, a lot of us aren t very lucky the first, the second, or even the third time when it comes to love. Sometimes, it takes a lot of bad and traumatic romantic experiences for us to really learn and grow; to discover more about what we re looking for in a relationship.That s why a lot of broken people are also the most emotionally mature ones. They understand the challenges that come with maintaining a healthy romantic relationship with another person. They are not blindsided by the harsh realities and difficulties of love. They know what to look for in people and they know what they want out of relationships.However, for those who are less experienced, you have lots to learn. For one, you should rid yourself of the notion that you are eventually going to meet a person who is going to tick everything off your checklist. In fact, throw away your checklist. You are never going to meet the perfect person because there are no perfect people. You will, however, meet some really great people who will be able to give you the perfect love a real one. And sometimes, real love comes in the weirdest packages. Here are a few reasons why it s okay for you to date someone who is just a little bit weird or crazy.You never want to be with someone who will act so jealous all the time to the point of controlling your every movement. But you always want your partner to have some mild fits of jealousy with you every once in a while. It lets you know that your partner is actually protective of you.&nbsp;

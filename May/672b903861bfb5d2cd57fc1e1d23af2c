A source has told Mzansilive that Amakhosi striker, Ryan Moon had a brush with death on Friday night when a car he was driving was involved in an accident on the N12 by the Southgate Shopping Centre in Johannesburg. He was driving a white Golf and another car, a grey Polo crashed into his from the back. He was not injured from what I saw and was so angry he was threatening to throw the other driver over a bridge. A friend who was driving a BMW talked him out of it, said the source.The source said when the passengers of the other car recognised him, they asked why he was not with the team who were going to play SuperSport United in a league game the next day. He said he was not in the team and was on his way home to KwaZulu-Natal, added the source.

Prior to the Sevens tournament rugby final played at the Stade Jean-Bouin in Paris on Sunday, the camera came across a sight that was perhaps not that familiar to world rugby audiences, but was definitely a taste of home for many South Africans.It s possible the camera crew had no idea what they were reading because they allowed the simple message #ZUMASEPOES that was scrawled on an official DHL poster by a Blitzboks fan to be broadcast to an audience of watching millions throughout the rugby world.Depending on what your opinion of President Jacob Zuma may be, let s hope he either is, or isn t, a big rugby fan.Zuma last month tried to dismiss the hundreds of thousands of South Africans marching against him on the streets of every major South African city as little more than a collection of racists, despite the fact that the majority of marchers were not white.As for the tournament itself, the Blitzboks went on to win their fifth title of the season and took an unassailable lead in the 2016/17 World Rugby Sevens Series in Paris on Sunday and will be crowned champions next week when the series concludes in London.South Africa outplayed Scotland 15-5 in the final of the French tournament and increased their lead over their rivals.

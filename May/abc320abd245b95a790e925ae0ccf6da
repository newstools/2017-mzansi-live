How come she gets sick every time she releases a new song? she asked.Since Mboro started praying for her, she has been feeling a bit better , and may not even go for the operation as her health has been improving everyday as she keeps paring with the prophet, she told the public.Mboro will also baptise her, as another way of coming closer to God and to grow her spirituality.The prophet told the publication he has put Khumalo in a programme called 49 Days of Journey with Mboro to pray with her.The songbird is not the first celebrity to approach Mboro for prayers, Brickz, Mshoza and Mapaputsi have also been there.

The Sowetan reported on Tuesday that Peter Zulu died on Monday after a long battle with cancer.His death comes less than a year after he buried his son Gugu who died after a trek up Mount Kilimanjaro for charity.&#8220;The passing of Gugu impacted [on] him badly just when we thought he was getting better &#8221; said Tseliso Motloheloa a family spokesperson.&#8220;It is hard because we had the passing of Gugu&#8217;s cousin from Welkom [Mohau Sekoto] in January. I think at the time when we were dealing with that pain of Mohau three months down the line Gugu&#8217;s dad passes. It had a cumulative effect on the family it is painful.&#8221;

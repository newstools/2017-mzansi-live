2017 has seen Skhumba&#8217;s brand grow more than he anticipated. The comedian bagged a radio breakfast show on Kaya FM and now co-presents a new car show called Change Down with Boity Thulo.Skhumba told MzansiLIVE that he has been having the best time on the show and the &#8220;feeling&#8221; he gets when he drives cars is something he has only ever dreamt about.&#8220;I am living out my wildest car fantasies. I mean, growing up our craziest car experiences were just car spinning shows,&#8221; he said.The comedian said the car show has also helped him understand why he has seen a lot of black people go into big debt for big machines.He said being made to feel &#8220;undeserving&#8221; of the [expensive] cars increases the satisfaction when &#8220;we own&#8221; them.&#8220;Because these cars are already &#8220;too good&#8221; for us to own, when we get a chance to drive or &#8220;buy&#8221; them, nothing can compare to that feeling. I will admit that the feeling I get when I&#8217;m enjoying that luxury or speed makes me understand why my brothers may feel like it&#8217;s all worth it. The debt I mean,&#8221; he said.Skhumba said he is happy to be part of a show that helps breakdown stereotypes around cars.He added that in the townships, people go all out to show off with cars but &#8220;proper car maintenance, insurance and prices&#8221; are never discussed.&#8220;We often buy cars we can&#8217;t afford, then Bra Boy [local mechanic] will service them and sometimes we don&#8217;t even consider the insurance payment when we plan to buy these cars. So I am glad I am on a show where a Thembisa boy can help people &#8216;break down&#8217; some of these barriers.&#8221;

I will always check up on her and make sure that she is on the right track prayer wise,&#8221; he said.As part of the program, Winnie will take part in prayer sessions with Mboro every Friday and Sunday until May 29.The pastor, who has previously helped the likes of Brickz and Mshoza, said that Winnie was doing well and on the road to recovery.&#8220;Winnie is doing great. She is co-operating and is a down to earth person. I told her to make time to pray,read the word of God and change her lifestyle. What I like about her is that she is a believer. I want to make sure that she is healed and bounces back,&#8221; Mboro said.

PASTOR Paseka Motsoeneng, known as Prophet Mboro, arrived at the Kgosi Mampuru Prison in Tshwane on Thursday with musical instruments and worshippers.The famous pastor wanted to pray for the inmates, but he got a nasty surprise . . .He was not allowed into the prison!The furious Incredible Happenings Ministries pastor said it was not the first time prison management had done this. My rights have been violated. I have been denied space to motivate and pray for offenders and warders, said Mboro.He said his visit was not for prayers only. We had plans for their rehabilitation, said Mboro. These people must be ready for a new life after prison. I run skills development initiatives, and I m also involved with construction companies. My plan was to make sure they get jobs when they leave prison. I discussed this with relevant people at the institution. I will be visiting the Constitutional Court to file my grievances with them. Gauteng correctional services spokesman Ofentse Morwane said approval had been granted, but when the church wanted to deviate from initial arrangements, the visit had to be cancelled. Our correctional services centres are secure institutions. Therefore, access is regulated, said Morwane.

The 25-year-old former FC Rostov defender is in his second season with Kaizer Chiefs, but he hasn t been able to cement his place in the Amakhosi starting lineup. It s now obvious that Siyanda won t play at Chiefs for as long as Komphela is still there. Now, if Chiefs retain Komphela, then the player will leave, Xulu s agent, Paul Mitchell, told Isolezwe. But if Komphela leaves then the player will stay and fight for the jersey under a new coach. So everything depends on whether Komphela stays or goes at the end of the season at Chiefs. The situation the player is faced with isn t easy. Siyanda is earning good money at Chiefs, and he s still contracted for the next three years. That makes it difficult to sell him. It s also not easy for him to take a pay cut, but because he s not playing, we may be forced to accept a pay cut so that he can move where he would get the chance to play. We re monitoring his situation. Xulu was transfer-listed by Chiefs at the end of last season, but was later removed from the list after impressing Steve Komphela.The former Bafana Bafana defender, however, has once again failed to break into the starting lineup at Amakhosi.

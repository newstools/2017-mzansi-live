Oskido is under investigation by the SABC.Because the Metro FM DJ has a big hit . . .AND THEY WANT TO KNOW WHY IT S SO POPULAR!Kalawa Jazmee Records guru and Metro FM DJ, Oskido (real name Oscar Mdlongwa) is rumoured to be in the hot seat at the broadcaster.MzansiLIVE can reveal that his latest hit song, AmaGrootman, is being investigated because some claim it s been getting too much airplay on all SABC radio stations!MzansiLIVE has learnt that internal auditors are visiting SABC provincial offices around the country and talking to compilers.&nbsp;A source in the SABC corridors said: Oskido is being targeted. What I find puzzling is that they were keeping it a secret and now he knows what s going on. Auditors are zig-zagging the country, asking compilers why AmaGrootman is getting much more airplay than other songs. Of all the artists who could pay for a song to get an unnatural boost, why only Oskido? Another insider said: Oskido s marketing campaign has made some people angry and it looks like they have complained to the big bosses. The song is charting on all radio stations. And it s up to individual radio stations to play AmaGrootman or not. He s a lucky man because all radio stations love it. According to another source, a DJ who refused to be named: They re just haters! Cassper was on the breakfast show with DJ Fresh this week, promoting his new song. They should also investigate him. We must give 90% to local content. The SABC wants us to play local music, and when we do, we are investigated. That s unfair! Yesterday, Oskido refused to comment. He referred MzansiLIVE to Universal Records local music director, Dharam Sewraj, who said: We sampled all stations for radio release equally. It was not only the SABC.SABC spokesman Kaizer Kganyago said: I m not aware of such an investigation. But generally, we don t talk about investigations because they are confidential.

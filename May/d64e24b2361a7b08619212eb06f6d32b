It&#8217;s probably the last thing a woman expects to see after going through labour and giving birth.But for Lucy Hellein, from Alabama, the situation was all too real, reports the Daily Mail.Her newborn son was delivered by midwives clutching her coil designed to stop her from getting pregnant in the first place.Since being uploaded to Facebook last week, the ironic photo of Dexter Tyler has amassed more than 71 000 shares to date, the website reported.She told Metro: &#8220;Dexter was definitely meant to be. His original due date was May 4th and even the doctor said &#8220;the force was strong with this one.Although he wasn&#8217;t planned, my family and I feel incredibly blessed.&#8221;Ms Hellein added that it was actually her third Mirena device, which is a hormonal form of the coil, also known as an IUS, she had been fitted with.Despite being fitted with the 99 per cent effective contraceptive in August last year, she discovered she was pregnant just before Christmas.She was told she was already 18 weeks gone, suggesting she had conceived just days after it was planted inside her uterus.

Edward, President Jacob Zuma s eldest son, has failed to be elected to any prominent position at the ANC branch where he ran for the position of chairperson.He remains a regular member of the ANC but has denied that he lost out to Bhengu, who won by a large majority of votes. Edward told MzansiLIVE it was not true that he had lost,and the meeting was postponed to a later date. No, he is lying. The branch meeting took place, and he did not make it as chairperson. He also did not make it as an additional member of the branch. I was there, said regional secretary Tholi Gwala.An ANC member told the newspaper that Edward s supporters could not enter the venue where the election was held. We are going to contest the outcome of the meeting because Edward s supporters were not allowed inside the school where the meeting was held, the source said.

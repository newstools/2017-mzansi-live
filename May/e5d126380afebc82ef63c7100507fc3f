How long did it take you to say &#8220;I love you&#8221;? I love you may be the three most powerful combination of words in the English language. A lot of us say it on a daily basis to the people who mean the most to us. It s a very basic means of acknowledging another person s worth in our lives. It is the essential tool for emotionally connecting to another person with whom we share intimacy and endearment. But sometimes, just when we re getting to know people in a relationship, we may have the irrational urge to blurt these three words out. We have to be able to take a step back and restrain ourselves.While saying I love you to your partner has its place in every relationship, it should all come in perfect time.True love can never be rushed. True love always needs its time underground to cultivate and develop into something real. You can t force it to grow on your preferred time. It will naturally find its way to the surface when the time is right. If you want your expression of love to be as genuine as possible, then make sure that your love in itself is already fully grown and cultivated.&nbsp;

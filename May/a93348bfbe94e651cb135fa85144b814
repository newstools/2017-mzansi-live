Relationships are tough and require a lot of energy and work. Most importantly, they require mutual respect and compromise. Respecting not only each others opinions, but also respecting each others needs and personal boundaries is very important to any healthy relationship. You need to be able to listen to each others needs and compromise so that both people are satisfied. You have to find a way to meet each other halfway and be willing to be vulnerable and talk about tough issues. Also, be respectful and provide a safe, open environment when your partner needs to express themselves about a tough issue. So, what are some signs that your relationship is in trouble?If you or your partner are criticizing each other over small things like how you dress or the way he eats, then that is a sign your relationship is in trouble. Nitpicking will eventually drive someone away no matter how much they initially loved you. People in a relationship need to feel that their partner not only loves them, but respects them and their choices.&nbsp;

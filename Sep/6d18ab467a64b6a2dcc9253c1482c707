DURBAN – African National Congress (ANC) national executive committee member Bheki Cele says anyone who denies that there are divisions in the governing party would be lying to themselves. Cele was speaking at the Shop Stewards’ Council in Durban earlier on Sunday. He was flanked by the SACP’s Blade Nzimande and Cosatu President Sdumo Dlamini. A passionate Cele has again lamented the divisions within the ANC, saying workers must be at the forefront of defending the movement or face losing the 2019 national general elections. On the ANC’s presidential race – Cele says he has not personally endorsed anyone but believes the organisation’s traditions must be upheld where the deputy succeeds the incumbent leader. In an explosive statement, Cele also shared a message which he says outlines plans to remove Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and create enough chaos in order for the elective conference not to go ahead. His comments come as there is mounting speculation that another Cabinet reshuffle is on the cards after presidential hopeful Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma was announced to be heading back to Parliament.

  You always have a cause for suspicion if your romantic partner only ever messages you when they are in need of something or if they are looking for some sexual favors. You should also be skeptical of when your boss asks you to do extra work unnecessarily even though you already did everything that was expected of you originally. These people are called users and you need to do either one of two things in these scenarios: call them out on their bad habits or walk away from them entirely. You have to stop compromising your own needs for the sake of others especially when you know that you’re not getting anything healthy out of it. You need to be able to just put your foot down and stand up for yourself. You can’t allow yourself to always be picking up after everyone else because you might end up neglecting all the things that you need to be doing for yourself. So how do you know when someone is using and abusing you? Here are some signs that could give you some reassurance. The discomfort that you’re feeling when you’re around this person is a direct result of your anxiety. You are always anxious that this person is going to ask something from you again as they always do. You have grown to expect these “favors” and you don’t like it.

MANY were shocked when pictures of soap branded with prophet Shepherd Bushiri s face went viral recently.The social media post showing the soap was captioned: Free to sin the whole day and cleanse yourself in the evening with this Bushiri soap. When the Malawi-born founder of Enlightened Christian Gathering Ministries was shown the photo, he soon took to Facebook to condemn whoever had posted it.He wrote: Beware of their propaganda against our ministry. After insisting the image was fake, he said: They are doing this to tarnish our name and the image of our ministry. A few months ago, they lied that we sell the blood of Jesus and that we sell anointed pregnancy tests. When the SunTeam phoned the church to find out whether Bushiri was selling soap at all, the woman who answered said she only worked in the call centre and it wasn t possible to speak to the prophet. She said she would get someone from the church to call back, but by time of going to print, no one had been in contact.Most Facebook users who saw the photo were on Bushiri s side.

This comes after reports emerged this weekend that the 22-year-old goalie has had to make do with a paltry salary that barely covers his transport costs.In a statement, Chiefs say they operate within a graded structure that provides the framework for contracts with players at development, reserve team and first team level.The Chiefs statement: Kaizer Chiefs noted the media reports regarding goalkeeper Bruce Bvuma s contract.The club would like to place on record that Bvuma has been part of the Kaizer Chiefs development structures since 2013/14.It was not anticipated that the player would be involved with the senior squad this season. However, after both first-team goalkeepers, Itumeleng Khune and Brilliant Khuzwayo, were sidelined through injury in March 2017, the club faced an emergency situation and, following a full assessment of the options available, elected to draft Bvuma into the senior squad after showing tremendous form in the MDC league.Kaizer Chiefs operates within a graded structure that provides the framework for contracts with players at development, reserve team and first team level.In so far as the details of players contracts are concerned, the terms and conditions of such agreements are confidential between the club, the player and their representative/parents.As such, the salaries are subject to negotiations between the club, the players and their representatives/parents, and all contracts are finalised through the mutual agreement of all parties concerned.

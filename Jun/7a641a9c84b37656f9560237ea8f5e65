I even sang gospel [music] at some point and right now I want to enter this exciting market of gqom sound and I don&#8217;t care if people think I&#8217;m too old. There&#8217;s no such thing, I make music that makes people happy and makes them dance,&#8221; Winnie said.The Live My Life hitmaker said she hopes to release her album before the end of the year under her business Winnie K.

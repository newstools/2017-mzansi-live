Comitis says he was expecting teams to make Tinkler an offer following his success with Cape Town City in their first season.MzansiLIVE confirmed on Thursday that the coach has left the club. Quite frankly we are very disappointed the way the thing has been handled is not how I would have liked Comitis told Times Media Digital. Eric didn t give me a chance to compete [financially] with the offer, and it was something we could have matched. All that was said previously was about commitment loyalty and the future. I thought I had Eric s trust. We were already in discussions about a new contract for him. To a large extent I was blindsided because although I knew an offer would be made to Eric it was a surprise to me that he would even consider it. That is disappointing along with the fact that we were not given the opportunity to match the offer.

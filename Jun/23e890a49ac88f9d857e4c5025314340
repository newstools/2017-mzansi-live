Nomandela was dropped by Cape Town City after two appearances in the 2016/2017 season.According to The Sowetan, the winger is struggling to pay back the money his friends lent him.One of his friends, Mika Chaka, told the publication: He just sent me a WhatsApp last month and asked me to help him. He wanted me to borrow him money, but I could only afford R500, so I sent that to him, and he said he will pay me back month end. Chaka said Nomandela was a bad payer, and he had known the 27-year-old for three years. I just let him be. He told me he doesn t have money, so I let go. I am going to make that money soon, but I worry about him because I hear he is dead broke now, Chaka added.Nomandela replied: I will pay him back. I didn t have the money, but he will get it.

 Who thought the ANC would face the music? he asked congregants during a service on Sunday at his Incredible Happenings church in Katlehong east of Johannesburg.He was joined by a special guest former SABC chief operating officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng.In his sermon Mboro said political leaders including presidents needed God. South Africa he added was in trouble because its leaders had forgotten about God. Kings come and go. Presidents come and go. Jobs come and go. Statuses come and go but God never leaves. He added: If high people are shaking and experiencing what they are experiencing what about an ordinary person? This should be a wake-up call to all of us. We need a man or a woman who will make a difference and not people who want to be popular but people who want to leave a mark. He said it was not game over for the embattled Motsoeneng. Until God says it s over for Hlaudi it s not over. The SABC is not your God. Politicians are not your God. Your salary is not your God. Hlaudi is our African brother. If he goes down he will not go down alone said Mboro.

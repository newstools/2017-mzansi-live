Agent Michael Ngobeni says the player is unhappy with the lack of game time at Chiefs, and is open to a loan deal.Ngobeni confirmed to Isolezwe they were already talking to a club that was interested in having the player on their bench for next season. The chances of Katsvairo playing for Chiefs next season are slim. He is not happy at Amakhosi since he is not playing. We are currently looking for a team that Chiefs can loan him to so that he can get game time. Ngobeni said they had not informed Chiefs of the club that they were in talks with, as there were a number of things they needed to iron out before the loan deal could be made official. We have not informed Chiefs of the team that we are talk to, there are a number of things that you need to consider, like the players salary, will both clubs go 50/50, or will the new club pay his salary? said Ngobeni.

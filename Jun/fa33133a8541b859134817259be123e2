Weather forecasters were expecting 80mm of rain to fall in the drought-stricken city.Meanwhile pupils could be forgiven for celebrating, not the rain, but the decision by the Western Cape administration to close all schools because of severe weather conditions from the storm. All of the schools are going to be closed tomorrow [Wednesday] and we&#8217;re asking people to stay home said James-Brent Styan spokesman for local government environmental affairs and development planning MEC Anton Bredell said.Snowfall was also expected over most high peaks of the Western Cape with moderate to heavy falls over Matroosberg.

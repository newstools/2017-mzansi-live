&#8220;Because my father (TV personality Khanyi Mbau&#8217;s father) didn&#8217;t raise me, I am who I am today. My environment socialised me to connect with my feminine side over my masculinity. I grew up peeing like the females in my house.&#8220;I did not know the difference until I watched a kids programme and saw boys peeing differently,&#8221; Dambuza said.&#8220;I believe if my father was hands on in my life I wouldn&#8217;t be gay, not that I blame him or regret who I am, it&#8217;s just an observation. I am not suggesting that females are the reason behind gayness, but in my life women have been pillars to a point where I was inspired to do what they do.&#8220;Being a gay man in South Africa is still a thing.

People like what I do but will not hire me because of my sexuality.&#8221;Dambuza said that because of the oppression that the LGBTIQ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Intersex and Queer) community faces in society, they are always motivated to work harder and succeed in order to prove their counterparts wrong.The internet sensation has 134444 followers on Facebook, 101149 on Instagram and 10826 on Twitter.

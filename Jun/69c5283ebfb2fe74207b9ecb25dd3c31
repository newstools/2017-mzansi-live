A TAXI driver was arrested on Friday for cramming 38 pupils into a 15-seater taxi. There were 40 people in the vehicle, including him and his taxi fare collector.Traffic cops stopped the Toyota Quantum on the M4 freeway off-ramp near Summerstrand.Three taxis had to be called to transport the pupils to Khumbulani High School in Port Elizabeth, while the driver was taken to the Sidwell traffic department.Traffic officer Joseph Ngcangca told MzansiLive: My partner and I were on duty when we saw an overloaded taxi. There were six people in front instead of three. We stopped the vehicle when we noticed this unusual seating arrangement and were surprised when we counted the pupils. They were crammed like sardines. The traffic officers said the pupils risked their lives because they thought they would pay half the price they usually do. The pupils told us they paid R10 each. They were surprised because taxis from the northern areas charge R5 when they are overloaded. We called the owner and three taxis arrived to take the pupils to school. We normally fine drivers R300 per person if the vehicle is overloaded with three people. In this case, I don t know how much the fine will amount to, said Ngcangca.Taxi owner Victor Dladla (42) told the traffic officers: I didn t instruct the driver to overload the vehicle. I am worried I might lose my road permit and it is the first time I have been involved in such a mess. The driver knows the rules he is supposed to follow, even if the pupils were desperate. I don t know what to do. He has put me in a difficult situation. I am also worried the pupils might have missed the test they were supposed to write. Police spokeswoman Captain Sandra van Rensburg confirmed the incident.She said: The driver (44) was arrested and will appear before the Port Elizabeth Magistrates Court today. &nbsp;
